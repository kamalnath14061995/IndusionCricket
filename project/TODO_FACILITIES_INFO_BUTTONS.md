# ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Move Additional Text to Info Buttons

## Task Description
Modified the facility features display to remove text after hyphens and inside brackets from the main display and move it to info buttons that users can click to see the additional information.

## Changes Made

### 1. AdminFacilities.tsx
- **Updated the feature display** in the admin list view to parse each feature using the `parseFeature` function
- **Added info buttons** next to features that have additional information (text in brackets or after hyphens)
- **Now shows only the description part** in the main display instead of the full feature text

### 2. FacilityCard.tsx
- **Already implemented correctly** - was already showing only the description part and using info buttons
- **No changes needed** as it was already following the desired pattern

## Implementation Details

### Before:
- Features were displayed as full text: "üèè International Standard Pitch (natural turf / hybrid / drop-in)"
- All text including the info in parentheses was visible in the main list

### After:
- Main display shows: "üèè International Standard Pitch" 
- Info button appears next to features with additional information
- Clicking the info button shows the detailed info: "natural turf / hybrid / drop-in"

## Files Updated
- `src/pages/AdminFacilities.tsx` - Modified the feature display in the admin list view
- `src/components/FacilityCard.tsx` - Already correct, no changes needed

## Technical Implementation
- Used the existing `parseFeature` helper function to extract:
  - Icon (first emoji/character)
  - Description (text after icon and before brackets/hyphen)
  - Info (text in brackets or after hyphen)
- Added info buttons with the Info icon for features that have additional information
- Maintained the same styling and layout consistency

## Testing
- The changes should be tested to ensure:
  - Info buttons appear only for features with additional information
  - The main display shows only the description part
  - The info popup functionality still works correctly
  - Admin interface displays features correctly in both list and edit modes
