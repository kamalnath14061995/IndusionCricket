# Facilities Checkboxes Implementation

## ✅ Task: Modify AdminFacilities.tsx to have initially unchecked checkboxes for features

### ✅ Completed Changes:
1. [x] Add state variables for availableFeatures and selectedFeatures
2. [x] Update handleTitleChange to set availableFeatures based on title selection
3. [x] Modify checkbox logic to use selectedFeatures instead of form.features
4. [x] Update save function to set form.features to selectedFeatures
5. [x] Update form display to show checkboxes for availableFeatures, checked based on selectedFeatures

### Implementation Details:
- When a title is selected, show all available features as checkboxes (initially unchecked)
- Admin can manually check/uncheck features they want to include
- Only checked features will be saved to the facility item
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing data structure

### Testing:
- Verify checkboxes are initially unchecked
- Test checking/unchecking functionality
- Verify only selected features are saved
- Test with different title selections
