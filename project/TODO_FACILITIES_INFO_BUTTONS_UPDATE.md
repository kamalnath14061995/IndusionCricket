# âœ… COMPLETED: Add Info Icon Buttons to Admin Dashboard

## Task Description
Added info icon buttons next to each feature in the admin dashboard that has additional information. When clicked, these buttons display the detailed information in a popup.

## Changes Made

### 1. AdminFacilities.tsx
- **Added InfoPopup import** to use the existing popup component
- **Added state management** for the info popup with `selectedFeatureDescription` state
- **Added click handler** `handleInfoClick` to show the detailed information
- **Added close handler** `closeInfoPopup` to hide the popup
- **Updated the info button** to call the click handler when clicked
- **Added InfoPopup component** to the render function

## Implementation Details

### Before:
- Info buttons were present but not functional in the admin dashboard
- Clicking the info button did nothing

### After:
- Info buttons now work in the admin dashboard
- Clicking an info button shows a popup with the detailed feature information
- The popup can be closed by clicking the close button or the "Close" button

## Files Updated
- `src/pages/AdminFacilities.tsx` - Added functional info buttons and popup

## Technical Implementation
- Used the existing `parseFeature` function to extract detailed info from feature text
- Reused the existing `InfoPopup` component for consistent UI
- Added state management for the popup visibility and content
- Connected the info button click events to show the appropriate information

## Testing
- The changes should be tested to ensure:
  - Info buttons appear only for features with additional information
  - Clicking an info button opens the popup with the correct information
  - The popup can be closed properly
  - All existing functionality remains intact
