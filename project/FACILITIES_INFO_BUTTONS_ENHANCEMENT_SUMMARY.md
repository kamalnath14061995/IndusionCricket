# âœ… ENHANCEMENT: Info Icon Button for Every Feature

## Task Description
Modified the implementation to show an info icon button next to every feature in the facilities section of the admin dashboard, regardless of whether there is additional information. When clicked, the button displays the detailed information extracted from the feature text.

## Changes Made

### 1. AdminFacilities.tsx
- **Removed conditional rendering** of info buttons to ensure they appear for every feature
- **Updated the click handler** to use the actual extracted information from the feature text
- **Maintained the existing functionality** for parsing feature text and displaying detailed information

## Implementation Details

### Before:
- Info buttons only appeared for features with additional information (text in brackets or after hyphens)
- Features without additional information did not have info buttons

### After:
- Info buttons appear next to every feature in the facilities section
- Clicking the info button shows the detailed information extracted from the feature text
- Features without additional information will show an empty popup (which can be enhanced later if needed)

## Files Updated
- `src/pages/AdminFacilities.tsx` - Modified the feature display to show info buttons for all features

## Technical Implementation
- Removed the conditional check `{info && (...)}` that was limiting info buttons to only features with additional information
- Updated the `onClick` handler to pass the actual `info` extracted from the feature text
- Maintained the existing `parseFeature` function logic for extracting icon, description, and info

## Testing
- The changes should be tested to ensure:
  - Info buttons appear next to every feature, regardless of whether there is additional information
  - Clicking an info button opens the popup with the correct detailed information
  - Features without additional information still display the info button (popup may be empty)
  - All existing functionality remains intact
