# Tournament Update Test

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema**: Made `month` and `year` nullable in `star_player_tournaments` table
2. **Backend Logging**: Added detailed logging for tournament processing
3. **Frontend Logging**: Added logging to track tournament data preparation
4. **Display Logic**: Improved tournament display to handle empty values

## Test Steps

1. **Edit a star player**
2. **Select tournaments** from the checkbox list
3. **Fill tournament details** (month, year, runs, wickets, matches) - some fields can be left empty
4. **Save the player**
5. **Check the logs** in browser console and backend logs
6. **Verify tournaments appear** in the player card under "Recent Tournaments"

## Expected Behavior

- Tournaments should be saved even with empty month/year
- Tournament names should appear in the player card
- Backend logs should show "Processing X tournaments for player"
- Frontend logs should show "Cleaned tournaments before save"

## Debug Information

Check for:
- Tournament data in browser console logs
- Backend processing logs
- Database records in `star_player_tournaments` table
- Player card display showing tournaments

If tournaments still don't appear, check:
1. Are tournaments being sent to the API? (frontend logs)
2. Are tournaments being processed by the backend? (backend logs)
3. Are tournaments being saved to database? (check database directly)
4. Are tournaments being returned in the API response? (network tab)
