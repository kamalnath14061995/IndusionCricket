# Coaching Program Management System - Architecture Summary

## System Overview
The coaching program management system is a comprehensive web application built with modern technologies, providing role-based access to coaching program management with full CRUD operations.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Backend Architecture (Spring Boot)
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x
- **Security**: Spring Security with JWT authentication
- **Database**: MySQL with JPA/Hibernate
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with role-based access
- **Validation**: Bean validation with custom error handling

### 2. Frontend Architecture (React)
- **Framework**: React 18.x with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors

### 3. Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables
- available_programs: Program information
- expert_coaches: Coach information
- program_coaches: Many-to-many relationship
- users: Authentication and roles
```

### 4. Security Model
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with expiration
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Roles**: ADMIN, COACH
- **Permissions**: 
  - ADMIN: Full CRUD access
  - COACH: Read-only access with search/filter
