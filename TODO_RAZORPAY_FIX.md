# Razorpay Authentication Fix

## Issue
- Razorpay authentication was failing due to missing API keys in application.yml

## Solution Applied
- Updated backend/src/main/resources/application.yml with Razorpay test keys:
  - Key ID: rzp_test_RCHTIPofbIz1gG
  - Key Secret: v3GgVh6KzPX9lfafaQE5rxqX

## Next Steps
- [ ] Restart the Spring Boot application to load the new configuration
- [ ] Test payment creation to verify Razorpay integration works
- [ ] If running in IDE, restart the application server
- [ ] If running via command line, stop and restart with: `mvn spring-boot:run` or `java -jar target/cricket-academy-api-1.0.0.jar`

## Notes
- These are test keys for development environment
- For production, use live keys and set via environment variables for security
- Ensure the application is restarted after config changes
