# SSL Handshake Fix for Upload-from-URL Feature

## Problem
The upload-from-URL functionality was failing with SSL handshake errors:
- "400 SSL handshake failed: No appropriate protocol (protocol is disabled or cipher suites are inappropriate)"
- Tried TLS versions: TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1, TLSv1

## Root Cause
The original implementation used an insecure approach:
1. Custom `TrustManager` that accepted all certificates (security risk)
2. Attempted to manually configure TLS versions with retry logic
3. Used potentially incompatible cipher suites

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Security Enhancement
- **Removed insecure TrustManager**: Eliminated the custom `X509TrustManager` that accepted all certificates
- **Using system default SSL context**: Now uses `SSLContext.getDefault()` which respects the system's trusted certificate store
- **Proper certificate validation**: Ensures SSL certificates are properly validated

### 2. Protocol and Cipher Suite Updates
- **Modern TLS protocols**: Focused on TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2 (removed deprecated TLSv1.1 and TLSv1)
- **Widely supported cipher suites**: Added modern, secure cipher suites including:
  - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256  
  - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
  - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - And other modern ECDHE-based ciphers

### 3. Code Improvements
- **Simplified error handling**: Removed complex retry logic with different TLS versions
- **Better error logging**: Enhanced error messages with detailed SSL handshake information
- **Cleaner imports**: Removed unused SSL-related imports
- **HTTP/2 support**: Added `HttpClient.Version.HTTP_2` for better performance

### 4. Security Headers
- **Updated User-Agent**: More modern browser user-agent string
- **Accept-Encoding header**: Added support for compression (gzip, deflate, br)

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/main/java/com/cricketacademy/api/controller/UploadController.java`
  - Complete rewrite of the `uploadFromUrl` method
  - Removed insecure certificate trust management
  - Added proper SSL configuration

## Testing
Created and executed `TestSSLFix.java` which successfully:
- Established SSL connection using the new configuration
- Made HTTPS request to httpbin.org
- Received HTTP 200 response with proper SSL handshake

## Benefits
1. **Security**: Proper certificate validation prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
2. **Compatibility**: Modern cipher suites work with most HTTPS servers
3. **Performance**: HTTP/2 support and better connection handling
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, simpler code without complex retry logic

## Next Steps
1. Test the upload-from-URL functionality with various external URLs
2. Monitor for any SSL-related issues in production
3. Consider adding more allowed domains to the security whitelist if needed
