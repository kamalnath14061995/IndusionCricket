# Alternative Tunneling Solutions for Razorpay Payment Testing

Since ngrok installation was blocked, here are several alternative approaches to expose your local server for Razorpay payment testing.

## üöÄ Quick Alternatives (Easiest to Setup)

### 1. **LocalTunnel (Recommended Alternative)**

LocalTunnel is an npm package that creates a tunnel without requiring downloads.

#### Installation:
```bash
npm install -g localtunnel
```

#### Usage:
```bash
# Start your backend on port 8080 first
# Then run:
lt --port 8080

# Or with a custom subdomain:
lt --port 8080 --subdomain yourappname
```

#### Integration:
Update your `application.yml`:
```yaml
app:
  payment:
    razorpay:
      base-url: https://yourappname.loca.lt
```

### 2. **Serveo SSH Tunneling (No Installation Required)**

Uses SSH to create tunnels - works on any system with SSH.

#### Usage:
```bash
# Start your backend on port 8080 first
# Then run:
ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 serveo.net

# Or with custom subdomain:
ssh -R yourappname:80:localhost:8080 serveo.net
```

#### Integration:
Your tunnel URL will be displayed (e.g., `https://yourappname.serveo.net`)

### 3. **Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared)**

Modern tunneling solution from Cloudflare.

#### Installation:
```bash
# Using winget (Windows Package Manager)
winget install cloudflare.cloudflared

# Or download from: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/
```

#### Setup:
```bash
# Login to Cloudflare
cloudflared tunnel login

# Create a tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create your-tunnel-name

# Configure the tunnel
cloudflared tunnel route dns your-tunnel-name yourappname.yourdomain.com

# Start the tunnel
cloudflared tunnel run your-tunnel-name
```

### 4. **VS Code Live Share**

If you're using VS Code, you can share your local server.

#### Setup:
1. Install "Live Share" extension in VS Code
2. Click "Live Share" in the status bar
3. Share the server link with yourself
4. Use the shared URL for Razorpay testing

### 5. **Browser Developer Tools**

For basic testing without external services:

#### Chrome DevTools Method:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Enable "Preserve log"
4. Make payment requests
5. Copy the request as cURL
6. Test with different URLs

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Based Solutions

### 6. **Railway.app (Free Tier Available)**

Deploy your backend to Railway for testing.

#### Setup:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Deploy the backend
4. Use the Railway URL for Razorpay

### 7. **Render.com (Free Tier)**

Similar to Railway with free tier.

#### Setup:
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Connect your repository
4. Deploy and get the URL

### 8. **Fly.io (Free Tier)**

Another option with generous free tier.

#### Setup:
```bash
# Install flyctl
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Login and deploy
fly launch
fly deploy
```

## üè† Local Network Solutions

### 9. **Port Forwarding (Router Configuration)**

Configure your router to forward external requests to your local machine.

#### Setup:
1. Access your router admin panel (usually 192.168.1.1)
2. Go to Port Forwarding/Virtual Server settings
3. Forward external port 8080 to internal IP:8080
4. Find your public IP: https://whatismyipaddress.com
5. Use `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:8080`

### 10. **Mobile Hotspot Testing**

Use your phone as a hotspot to test from external network.

#### Setup:
1. Connect your development machine to phone hotspot
2. Start backend on 0.0.0.0:8080
3. Use your computer's hotspot IP for testing

## üîß Configuration Updates

For any tunneling solution, update your `application.yml`:

```yaml
app:
  payment:
    razorpay:
      base-url: YOUR_TUNNEL_URL_HERE
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Test Commands:

```bash
# Test if your tunnel is working
curl https://your-tunnel-url/api/payments/config

# Test with authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     https://your-tunnel-url/api/payments/razorpay/order \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"amount": 10000, "currency": "INR"}'
```

### Browser Testing:
1. Open your tunnel URL in browser
2. Verify you can access the API
3. Test the payment flow end-to-end

## üìã Comparison Table

| Solution | Setup Time | Reliability | Cost | Installation Required |
|----------|------------|-------------|------|----------------------|
| LocalTunnel | 2 minutes | Good | Free | npm only |
| Serveo | 1 minute | Good | Free | None |
| Cloudflare | 5 minutes | Excellent | Free | Download required |
| Railway | 10 minutes | Excellent | Free tier | None |
| Port Forwarding | 5 minutes | Variable | Free | Router access |

## üéØ Recommended Approach

**For immediate testing**: Use **Serveo** (no installation required)
**For reliable development**: Use **LocalTunnel** (npm package)
**For production-like testing**: Use **Railway.app** or **Render.com**

## üîí Security Considerations

- These tunnels are for development only
- Don't expose sensitive endpoints
- Use HTTPS URLs provided by the tunneling service
- Monitor your server logs for unusual activity

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Connection Refused**: Ensure your backend is running on the correct port
2. **CORS Errors**: Update your CORS configuration with the tunnel URL
3. **Authentication Issues**: Make sure JWT tokens are being sent correctly
4. **Timeout Errors**: Some free tunnels have timeout limits

### Debug Steps:
1. Test tunnel connectivity: `curl https://your-tunnel-url`
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Verify Razorpay configuration
4. Test with simple API endpoints first
