# Security Vulnerability Report

## Table: `career_applications`

Below is an analysis of the provided SQL table schema, with a focus solely on security vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. Sensitive Data Exposure

### a. Email and Phone Fields

- The `email` and `phone` columns contain personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Vulnerability:** Storing PII without encryption or hashing can lead to data breaches if the database is compromised.
- **Mitigation:** Consider encrypting sensitive fields at rest using database-level or application-side encryption.

---

## 2. Lack of Column-Level Input Validation

### a. Name, Email, Phone, Position Type, Qualifications, Experience

- These fields are susceptible to **SQL Injection** and **Stored XSS** (if application input is not sanitized).
- **Vulnerability:** SQL doesn’t perform escaping or sanitization; if the application layer is not careful, malicious data could be stored.
- **Mitigation:** 
    - Use parameterized queries for all database access.
    - Sanitize input and escape output on application/UI layer.

---

## 3. ENUM Status Values

- The `status` field is constrained to `'PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED'` via ENUM, which is good for data integrity.
- **Vulnerability:** If application code does not validate user input, attackers could attempt to inject improper status values before data reaches the SQL engine (though the invalid data will be rejected at insert/update).
- **Mitigation:** Validate allowed values at the application layer as well.

---

## 4. Timing Attacks & Metadata Exposure

### a. `created_at` Field

- The automatic storage of creation timestamps can provide metadata for attackers (e.g., timing-based inference attacks).
- **Vulnerability:** Attackers could infer volume, frequency of applications, or perform enumeration.
- **Mitigation:** Limit metadata exposure via API responses and consider aggregation instead of exposing raw creation timestamps.

---

## 5. Index Exposure

- Indexes on sensitive fields (e.g., `position_type`, `status`) could marginally aid adversaries in inference if direct DB access is gained (enabling efficient queries).
- **Vulnerability:** Indexed fields are more rapidly searchable for attackers with low-level DB access, possibly aiding mass data extraction.
- **Mitigation:** Monitor database access and audit logs; ensure proper database-level access controls.

---

## 6. Auditing and Logging

- There is **no logging/auditing** field for tracking who made/modified records.
- **Vulnerability:** Lack of auditing may delay detection of malicious or unauthorized changes.
- **Mitigation:** Add fields such as `created_by`, `updated_by`, and use triggers or application logic for audit trails.

---

## 7. No Data Integrity for Email Uniqueness

- The `email` field is not unique.
- **Vulnerability:** Not a direct security issue, but could allow for enumeration/brute force of email addresses if the application provides verbose error messages.
- **Mitigation:** Consider if uniqueness is needed and design error messages to be generic.

---

## 8. No Row-Level Security

- No built-in mechanism for row-level security (who can read/update what).
- **Vulnerability:** If the application layer lacks control, users may access or modify others’ records.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce row-level access checks in the application logic.

# Recommendations

1. Encrypt sensitive data (especially PII fields).
2. Enforce strict input validation in your application.
3. Do not expose raw creation timestamps to end users.
4. Monitor and audit database access.
5. Implement application-layer access controls.
6. Add audit trails.

**Note:** While these issues are observable at the schema level, most SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities depend on how the application interacts with this schema. Make sure your application securely interfaces with the database as well.
