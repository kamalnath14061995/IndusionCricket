## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets in Source Code

**Description:**  
The configuration file contains sensitive information such as `cashfree.appId` and `cashfree.secretKey`. Keeping such secrets in plain text within files that might be committed to version control systems poses a severe security risk.

**Risks:**  
- Credentials could be leaked if the repository is shared, made public, or accessed by unauthorized users.
- Exposure allows attackers to impersonate your application or access your Cashfree account, leading to financial loss or service disruption.

**Recommendation:**  
- Never store secrets in plaintext within source code or configuration files.
- Use environment variables or secured secret management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to manage sensitive data.
- Ensure that `.gitignore` or equivalent ignores files with secrets.

### 2. Weak JWT Expiration Policy

**Description:**  
JWT expiration (`app.jwt.expiration=600000`) is set to 10 minutes. While short-lived tokens are generally more secure, the configuration itself is not vulnerable. However, if code or configuration allows for external manipulation, attackers could exploit this to set excessively long expiration periods or disable expiration altogether.

**Risks:**  
- Potential misconfiguration via insecure code or privilege escalation.
- Session hijacking or replay attacks if expiration is extended or bypassed.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure only authorized and authenticated administrators can change security-critical settings like token expiration.
- Validate values for security best practices in your application logic.

### 3. Lack of Environment Segregation

**Description:**  
The configuration mentions `cashfree.env=TEST`, but does not indicate any clear method of segregating environments (development, testing, production). Using the wrong credentials or environment settings in production could expose real user data or financial transactions.

**Risks:**  
- Leakage of test credentials into production, or vice versa.
- Unsecure test endpoints or weak test credentials used in live environments.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure strict separation of environments, with unique credentials and configurations for each.
- Use strong access controls for production secrets and configurations.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability Type         | Severity | Recommendation                                       |
|---------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded credentials     | HIGH     | Remove from code, use secret managers/env variables  |
| Poor secret management    | HIGH     | Use secret management best practices                 |
| Weak token expiry config  | MEDIUM   | Restrict configuration access, validate inputs       |
| Lack of env segregation   | MEDIUM   | Separate configs and secrets per environment         |

## General Recommendations

- Audit and rotate any leaked or hardcoded keys immediately.
- Ensure configuration files are not included in version control (`.gitignore`).
- Review application code to prevent environmental variables/configuration overwrites.
- Perform regular security reviews and compliance scans.

**Note:**  
Even though the placeholder values (`YOUR_CASHFREE_APP_ID`, `YOUR_CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY`) are not real, the vulnerability exists if real secrets are treated the same way in production systems. Always follow best practices for securing sensitive information.
