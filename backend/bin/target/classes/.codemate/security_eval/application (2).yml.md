# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the configuration code provided for potential **security vulnerabilities**. The code consists of a typical Spring Boot `application.yml` setup for a backend API with database, logging, and JWT configurations.

## 1. **Hardcoded Database Credentials**

**Location:**
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    username: root
    password: Kamal@146
```

**Vulnerability:**
- **Hard-coding sensitive credentials** in a configuration file (especially source-controlled ones) exposes your database account to anyone who can access the repository.
- The use of the default MySQL root account is discouraged as it has complete privileges.

**Recommendations:**
- Use environment variables or a vault solution (e.g., Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Avoid using privileged accounts like `root`. Create a dedicated DB user with the minimum required privileges.

## 2. **Disabling SSL for Database Traffic**

**Location:**
```yaml
url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cricket_academy?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
```

**Vulnerability:**
- `useSSL=false` disables encryption for the database connection, so credentials and data could be intercepted (even in "localhost", this can lead to bad practices in production).

**Recommendations:**
- Set `useSSL=true` and properly configure certificates for encrypted connections.
- Never use `useSSL=false` in production.

## 3. **Logging Sensitive Data (High Log Verbosity)**

**Location:**
```yaml
logging:
  level:
    org.hibernate.SQL: DEBUG
    org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql.BasicBinder: TRACE
```

**Vulnerability:**
- The logging levels `DEBUG` and particularly `TRACE` for `SQL` statements and variable binding can expose sensitive information, including user data and authentication details, in plaintext in logs.

**Recommendations:**
- Lower the log level to `WARN` or `ERROR` in production.
- Sanitize SQL logs to prevent leakage of sensitive data.

---

## 4. **Weak or Placeholder JWT Secret Key**

**Location:**
```yaml
app:
  jwt:
    secret: your-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-secure-in-production
```

**Vulnerability:**
- Placeholder secrets or weak keys drastically reduce JWT token security.
- Reusing a simple or default string makes brute-force or dictionary attacks easier.

**Recommendations:**
- Always use a strong, cryptographically random, and sufficiently long secret for JWT signing.
- Securely rotate secrets if exposure is detected.
- Store secrets outside of code in secure, managed secret stores.

---

## 5. **Possible Exposure of Sensitive Configuration in Source Control**

**Observation:**
- This configuration file likely contains sensitive information and should not be committed to public or shared repositories.

**Recommendations:**
- Add configuration files to `.gitignore`, or use separate, environment-specific configuration for sensitive values.

## Summary Table

| Issue                               | Risk Level | Recommendation                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded DB credentials             | High       | Use environment variables or secret vault                       |
| Disabling DB SSL                     | High       | Enable SSL for database connections                             |
| Excessive SQL log verbosity          | Medium     | Limit log levels, sanitize logs                                 |
| Weak/placeholder JWT secret          | High       | Use a strong, random key; keep out of codebase                  |
| Sensitive config in source control   | High       | Do not commit secrets/configs to public or shared repositories  |

# Remediation Steps

1. Move all secrets to secure storage solutions.
2. Enable SSL/TLS for all communications, especially database connections.
3. Limit logging of sensitive operations and review logs regularly for leakage.
4. ALWAYS use secure, random JWT secrets for token signing.
5. Regularly audit codebases and configuration for accidental exposures.
