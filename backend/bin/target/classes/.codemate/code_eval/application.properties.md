# Critical Code Review Report

**Configuration File Provided:**

```plaintext
# Cashfree credentials (replace with your actual values)
cashfree.appId=YOUR_CASHFREE_APP_ID
cashfree.secretKey=YOUR_CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY
cashfree.env=TEST

# JWT expiration set to 10 minutes (600000 ms)
app.jwt.expiration=600000
```

---

## 1. **Sensitive Information in Configuration**

### **Issue**
- Credentials (`appId` and `secretKey`) are stored in plaintext in the configuration. If this file is checked into version control, it risks exposing sensitive keys.

### **Best Practices**
- Do **not** hard-code sensitive credentials in version-controlled files.
- Use environment variables or secure secrets management systems for such values.

### **Suggested Correction (Pseudo code)**
```pseudo
# Use placeholders and retrieve actual values from environment
cashfree.appId=${CASHFREE_APP_ID}
cashfree.secretKey=${CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY}
```

---

## 2. **Configuration for Different Environments**

### **Issue**
- The environment is set statically to `TEST`, which could lead to accidental use of test environments in production.

### **Best Practices**
- Parameterize the environment value and control it via deployment pipeline or environment variable.

### **Suggested Correction (Pseudo code)**
```pseudo
cashfree.env=${CASHFREE_ENV:TEST}
# (Defaults to "TEST" but can be overridden)
```

---

## 3. **JWT Expiration Hardcoding**

### **Issue**
- JWT expiration is configurable, but the comment may be misleading as `600000` ms = 10 min, but time units should ideally be explicit to avoid future confusion.

### **Best Practices**
- Use explicit units in properties for clarity.
- Alternatively, document the unit in a standard way (e.g., "10m" for 10 minutes).

### **Suggested Correction (Pseudo code)**
```pseudo
app.jwt.expiration=10m
# or, app.jwt.expiration=600000 # milliseconds (document unit explicitly)
```

---

## 4. **Lack of Secure Secrets Handling**

### **Issue**
- No mention of secure handling (rotation, access control, audit).

### **Recommendation**
- Use a secrets manager or external vault for credentials.
- Ensure access control and auditing is in place.

### **Suggested Correction (Pseudo code)**
```pseudo
# Retrieve credentials securely from a secrets manager at runtime.
cashfree.appId=readSecret('cashfree/appId')
cashfree.secretKey=readSecret('cashfree/secretKey')
```

---

## 5. **No Sample/Fallback Values**

### **Issue**
- Using placeholders like `YOUR_CASHFREE_APP_ID` is risky; omitting defaults or providing a fallback could prevent misconfiguration in deployments.

### **Best Practices**
- Fail startup if the values are not provided or provide explicit instruction in README.

## **Summary Table**

| Issue                        | Original              | Suggested Correction      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Plaintext credentials        | `YOUR_CASHFREE_APP_ID`| `${CASHFREE_APP_ID}`     |
| Static environment           | `TEST`                | `${CASHFREE_ENV:TEST}`   |
| Vague expiration units       | `600000`              | `10m` or `600000` (ms)   |
| No secrets handling advice   | -                     | See above                |
| Placeholder values           | (default present)     | Fail if unset            |

---

## **Final Recommendations**

- Never commit real secrets to version control.
- Use environment variables, CI/CD, or a dedicated secrets manager.
- Always use explicit units in config, and validate configuration on startup.
- Document all configuration options clearly for users and operators.
