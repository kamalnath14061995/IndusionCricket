# Configuration Code Review Report

## General Observations

- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Sensitive credentials (database password, JWT secret) are directly in the configuration file.
- **Industry Best Practices:** Some parameters should use environment variables or secret managers, not hardcoded values.
- **Optimization:** Certain property values can be refined for security, maintainability, and better logging control.
- **Error Prone Areas:** Exposing debug/trace logs and open SQL output in production can be security and performance issues.
- **Documentation:** Inline documentation for key config values is recommended for future maintainers.

## Detailed Issues and Corrections

### 1. Sensitive Data Exposure (Database Password & JWT Secret)

**Issue:**  
Database password and JWT secret are hardcoded in the config file.

**Correction (Pseudo Code):**
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    # Replace with environment variable reference or ${} notation
    username: ${DB_USERNAME}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
app:
  jwt:
    # Replace with environment variable reference or ${} notation
    secret: ${JWT_SECRET}
```

### 2. Logging Level in Production

**Issue:**  
`DEBUG` and `TRACE` levels for application and libraries may leak sensitive data and hurt performance in production.

**Correction (Pseudo Code):**
```yaml
logging:
  level:
    com.cricketacademy.api: INFO        # or WARN for production
    org.springframework.security: WARN  # or ERROR for production
    org.hibernate.SQL: ERROR            # Only enable DEBUG for dev
    org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql.BasicBinder: ERROR
```
_Note: Set these dynamically according to the deployment environment (dev/stage/prod)._

---

### 3. JPA open-in-view Configuration

**Issue:**  
`open-in-view: false` is generally correct but document why, as it changes transaction/EntityManager scope. Could impact repository/service code.

**Suggestion:**
```yaml
# open-in-view: false # Maintainers: Ensures no lazy-loading outside transaction scope
```
_Add documentation comment for future maintainers._

---

### 4. Secure Database Connection

**Issue:**  
`useSSL=false` and `allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true` make connection vulnerable to MiTM and are acceptable only for local/dev but not for production.

**Correction (Pseudo Code):**
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    # In production:
    url: jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port>/<db>?useSSL=true&requireSSL=true&serverTimezone=UTC
```
---

### 5. Password Policy

**Issue:**  
Complex password seen, but storing in YAML is unsafe. Use environment variable or secret store.

**Correction:**  
See first issue (use `${DB_PASSWORD}`).

---

### 6. Port Hardcoding

**Observation:**  
Port 8080 is common but ensure it's not in use and allow override via environment variable.

**Correction (Pseudo Code):**
```yaml
server:
  port: ${SERVER_PORT:8080}
```
---

### 7. SQL DDL-Auto Configuration

**Issue:**  
`ddl-auto: update` can be dangerous in production; it can unintentionally change schema.

**Correction (Pseudo Code):**
```yaml
jpa:
  hibernate:
    ddl-auto: none     # In production
    # Use `update` or `validate` in dev/test, switch to `none` for production.
```
---

### 8. JWT Expiration Value

**Observation:**  
Document time unit clearly and make configurable per environment.

**Suggestion (Pseudo Code):**
```yaml
app:
  jwt:
    expiration: ${JWT_EXPIRATION:86400000} # ms, configurable
```
---

### 9. Add Comments & Naming Consistency

**Suggestion:**
- Add comments for complex or security-critical configurations.
- Ensure property naming is self-explanatory.

## Summary Table

| Issue                         | Suggested Correction                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Credentials in YAML           | Use environment variables                     |
| Debug/Trace log levels        | Use INFO/WARN/ERROR for prod                  |
| open-in-view: false unexplained| Add maintenance comments                     |
| Insecure MySQL connection     | Enforce SSL in production connection          |
| Port hardcoding               | Use environment variable with default         |
| ddl-auto: update in prod      | Use `none` or `validate` in production        |
| JWT secret hardcoded          | Use environment variable                      |
| JWT expiration fixed          | Support environment override                  |

**Example Pseudocode Insertion:**
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    # ...
app:
  jwt:
    secret: ${JWT_SECRET}
```
Remove sensitive hardcoded data!

# Final Recommendation

- **Always externalize secrets and configuration for production.**
- **Do not use DEBUG/TRACE logging in production.**
- **Document reasons for specific settings, especially when deviating from defaults.**
- **Review configuration per environment (dev/test/prod) for safety and compliance.**

Please address these issues before moving to production or sharing the code repository.
