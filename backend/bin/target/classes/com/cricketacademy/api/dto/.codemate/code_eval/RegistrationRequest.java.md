# Code Review Report

**File**: `RegistrationRequest.java`  
**Package**: `com.cricketacademy.api.dto`

---

## 1. Package & Import Statements

- **Observation**:  
  The import statements seem accurate and standard.  
  Jakarta validation (`jakarta.validation.constraints`) is appropriate.
- **Recommendation**:  
  Ensure all Lombok dependencies are available during build and runtime.

---

## 2. Data Annotations & Field Validation

- **Observation**:  
  Most basic validation annotations are applied. The mapping of form data to DTO is sensible.

### Potential Issues / Omissions

#### a) Password Security

- **Issue**:  
  The password field is annotated only with `@Size`. There is no constraint for strong passwords, such as requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters. This could result in weak user passwords.
- **Suggestion**:  
  Add a regex pattern for stronger password requirements.

  ```java
  @Pattern(regexp = "^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#$%^&+=!]).{6,}$", 
           message = "Password must have at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character")
  ```

#### b) Phone Pattern (Internationalization)

- **Issue**:  
  The current phone regex accepts numbers with an optional '+', but might not cover all valid international formats.  
- **Suggestion**:  
  Ensure the phone number handling at the backend is normalized and validated according to the region as needed. If international users are not expected, restrict accordingly.

#### c) Email Case Standardization

- **Issue**:  
  Email addresses can be in mixed case, but most authentications require lowercased emails. No mechanism exists to normalize case or trim whitespace.
- **Suggestion (pseudocode):**

  ```pseudo
  // In the RegistrationRequest DTO, add a method to normalize the email, e.g.:
  public void setEmail(String email) {
      this.email = (email == null) ? null : email.trim().toLowerCase();
  }
  ```

#### d) Ensuring Consistency in Setter Methods

- **Issue**:  
  Lombok's @Data generates standard setters, but if you provide any custom setter (e.g., as above for email), you should decide if you want to make all setters custom, or annotate the class/methods appropriately to avoid confusion.

#### e) Null/Blank Handling for ExperienceLevel

- **Observation**:  
  The `experienceLevel` field is annotated with `@NotNull`.  
  If this is an enum, ensure null-safe deserialization and handle unknown values robustly at the REST controller/service layer.

#### f) Open Validation Loopholes

- **Password**:  
  `@NotBlank` should be used with caution as it allows whitespace as a valid password. Consider trimming input.

---

## 3. Documentation

- **Observation**:  
  The class-level comment is clear and concise.

### Recommendation

- For complex patterns, document the intention inline for maintainability.

  ```java
  // Pattern: At least one digit, one uppercase, one lowercase, one special character, min 6 chars
  ```

---

## 4. Field Ordering

- **Observation**:  
  Field ordering matches typical registration forms; optional.

---

## 5. Additional Suggestions (Industry Best Practices)

- **Constructor Usage**:  
  If this DTO is used in serialization frameworks (e.g., Jackson), ensure compatibility with the used constructor.

# Summary Table

| Area              | Issue/Oversight                                 | Suggestion/Correction                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Password Security | Weak validation                                 | Add regex pattern for strength (see below)                 |
| Email Handling    | No normalization (trimming/casing)              | Add setter normalization logic                             |
| Phone Regex       | May not handle all international formats        | Reconsider or document intended number format              |
| Password Handling | Allowing whitespace as valid password character | Consider trimming & stricter pattern                       |

# Corrected Code Fragments (Pseudocode)

```java
// Enhanced Password Validation
@Pattern(regexp = "^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#$%^&+=!]).{6,}$", 
         message = "Password must have at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character")
// Pattern: At least one digit, one uppercase, one lowercase, one special character, min 6 chars
private String password;

// Email Setter to Normalize Input
public void setEmail(String email) {
    this.email = (email == null) ? null : email.trim().toLowerCase();
}
```

# Final Notes

- Document validation patterns for future maintainability.
- Discuss specific phone/email validation schemes suitable for your user base.
- Always consider how input data is preprocessed, both before validation (DTO) and in further backend domains.
- Custom setters override Lombok. Document intent for other developers.
