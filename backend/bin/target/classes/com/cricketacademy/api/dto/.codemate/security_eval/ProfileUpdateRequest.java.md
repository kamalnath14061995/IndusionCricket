# Security Vulnerability Report for `ProfileUpdateRequest` DTO

## Overview

This report analyzes the code for the `ProfileUpdateRequest` class from a security perspective, focusing solely on security vulnerabilities or patterns that could lead to vulnerabilities in the context of typical Java/Spring Boot web applications.

## Code Review

```java
package com.cricketacademy.api.dto;

import com.cricketacademy.api.entity.User;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.*;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class ProfileUpdateRequest {

    @NotBlank(message = "Name is required")
    @Size(min = 2, max = 100, message = "Name must be between 2 and 100 characters")
    private String name;

    @NotBlank(message = "Phone number is required")
    @Pattern(regexp = "^[+]?[0-9]{10,15}$", message = "Phone number should be valid")
    private String phone;

    @NotNull(message = "Age is required")
    @Min(value = 5, message = "Age must be at least 5")
    @Max(value = 80, message = "Age must be at most 80")
    private Integer age;

    @NotNull(message = "Experience level is required")
    private User.ExperienceLevel experienceLevel;
}
```

## Identified Security Issues

### 1. **Lack of Output Encoding / Data Sanitization**

**Risk:**  
None of the fields in the DTO are being encoded or sanitized on their own. While validation annotations are present, they do not sanitize or encode input, just validate format and length. If this DTO is later directly used to render data in views (such as in JSP/XML/HTML), it opens up potential for stored/reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Recommendation:**  
- Always encode/sanitize user-controlled inputs before rendering them in the UI.
- Avoid direct use of untrusted input in dynamic data sinks.

### 2. **Lack of Logging Control**

**Risk:**  
While not explicitly shown in this DTO, if validation error messages (such as those provided in the annotations) are logged or returned to clients as-is, they can provide an attacker with useful information for input validation bypass or information disclosure.

**Recommendation:**  
- Audit error handling and logging in the controller/service layers for excessive information exposure.

### 3. **Enumeration Exposure (`ExperienceLevel`)**

**Risk:**  
The `experienceLevel` field uses a direct reference to an internal enum (`User.ExperienceLevel`). If not properly mapped/validated, this can allow:
- Mass assignment vulnerabilities (attacker sets an aggressive or undefined enum value)
- Unexpected values if the enum is extended or changed in the future

**Recommendation:**  
- Strictly validate allowed enum values in the controller/service layer, even if using built-in binding.
- Avoid exposing internal enums to API consumers if possible. Use a DTO-specific enum or a validated string/number representation.

### 4. **No Mechanism for Preventing Over-Posting / Mass Assignment**

**Risk:**  
Using Lombok's `@Data` automatically generates getters and setters for all fields. While this is convenient, it makes over-posting (mass assignment) risks harder to spot in the codebase, especially if this DTO is mapped directly to an entity.

**Recommendation:**  
- Avoid using generic mapping tools (like MapStruct/ModelMapper) to blindly map DTOs to Entities.
- Review which fields should be updatable, and ensure only the intended ones are included in the DTO and mapped manually if needed.

### 5. **Pattern Validation for Phone Number**

**Risk:**  
While a strict regular expression for phone numbers is a good practice, insufficient validation could allow attacker to bypass expected format checks if used in a context where additional format enforcement is expected, or if numbers are used in SMS/telephony systems (number spoofing, injection).

**Recommendation:**  
- Make sure downstream logic for telephony/SMS also validates phone numbers and escapes input as needed.

## General Recommendations

- Complement Javax/Jakarta validation with appropriate business logic and security checks in the controller/service layers.
- Use allow-lists rather than block-lists wherever feasible (i.e., explicitly define valid enum values).
- Avoid exposing internal types, such as enums coupled from entity classes, directly in API DTOs.
- Review all uses of error messages to ensure no sensitive information is leaked.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                              | Risk Level | Recommendation                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No output encoding/sanitization            | Medium     | Encode/sanitize user input before rendering or further usage.    |
| Error message exposure                     | Low        | Check error handling for information disclosure risks.           |
| Enum exposure/mapping                      | Medium     | Validate enum values strictly and avoid exposing internals.      |
| Over-posting (mass assignment)             | Medium     | Control setter access; avoid generic DTO-entity mapping.         |
| Phone number validation limitations        | Low        | Validate and sanitize phone numbers in downstream logic as well. |

## Conclusion

No critical vulnerabilities are present in the DTO code as written. However, care must be taken in how this DTO is used in the application layers, particularly with respect to output encoding, enum mapping, and DTO-to-entity data flows, to avoid introducing security risks.
