# Security Vulnerabilities Report

This report reviews the security aspects of the provided RegistrationRequest DTO code, specifically focusing on potential vulnerabilities and risks relevant to secure software development.

---

## 1. Password Handling

**Observation**:  
The `password` field is a plain `String` and there are no annotations or code snippets indicating special handling or protection.

**Vulnerabilities**:

- **Exposure in Memory**: `String` objects are immutable in Java and stored in the string pool, which means passwords can persist in memory until garbage collected, increasing the risk of exposure via memory dumps.
- **Logging/Lombok Risk**: The `@Data` annotation from Lombok automatically generates `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` methods, all of which could potentially include the password field, leading to accidental logging or exposure in logs, exceptions, or debug output.
- **No Complexity Enforcement**: The only constraint is a minimum length of 6. No checks for complexity (such as digits, uppercase, lowercase, or symbols) are in place.

**Mitigations**:

- Use `@ToString(exclude = "password")` or annotate `password` with `@ToString.Exclude` to prevent it from appearing in `toString()`.
- Consider using character arrays (`char[]`) for passwords for faster clearing from memory.
- Add password complexity requirements to reduce weak password risks.
- Never log raw password values.

## 2. No Input Sanitization or Output Encoding

**Observation**:  
The class uses Java validation annotations (e.g., `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`), which perform input validation but not output encoding or full sanitization.

**Vulnerability**:

- **Injection Attacks**: If these fields (especially `name` and `email`) are later rendered in HTML/SQL without proper escaping/parameterization, the application may be vulnerable to XSS, SQL Injection, or other injection attacks.

**Mitigations**:

- Always encode/sanitize output when displaying user input back to the frontend or using it in queries.
- Validate and restrict the accepted character set beyond generic constraints, especially for fields that may be rendered in HTML/JavaScript.

## 3. ExperienceLevel Enum Deserialization

**Observation**:  
`private ExperienceLevel experienceLevel;` is a field mapped from client input, most likely via deserialization.

**Vulnerability**:

- **Mass Assignment and Enumeration**: If the enum values include privileged/unexpected values ("ADMIN", etc.), and are not checked, an attacker can submit any allowed string value, possibly escalating privileges if misconfigured elsewhere.

**Mitigations**:

- Ensure `ExperienceLevel` includes only safe, non-privileged values.
- Validate input strictly and avoid trusting client-provided enum values for authorization decisions.

---

## 4. Lack of Anti-Automation/Anti-Abuse Features

**Observation**:  
DTO alone does not implement rate-limiting or CAPTCHA, but registration endpoints are a frequent target of automated attacks.

**Vulnerability**:

- **Brute-force & Automated Registrations**: Weak password constraints, plus no CAPTCHA or rate limiting, make the endpoint vulnerable to automated registration.

**Mitigations**: (beyond DTO)
- Enforce rate limiting and CAPTCHAs at the API level.

---

## 5. Age and Phone Number Validation

**Observation**:  
Phone numbers are validated via regex, and age is within bounds.

**Vulnerabilities**:

- **Enum/Type Coercion**: No specific security risk, but improper handling could allow bypass if code assumes phone/age are securely validated elsewhere.

| Automated abuse of registration| Medium     | Brute-force attacks possible         | Use CAPTCHA and rate limiting at endpoint       |

# Recommendations

- **Password Handling**: Exclude password from auto-generated `toString()`, consider storing as `char[]`, and enforce password complexity.
- **Logging**: Be careful that sensitive information is never logged.
- **Output Encoding**: Ensure all user input fields are encoded on output.
- **Enum Handling**: Vet all possible enum values to ensure they cannot be abused.
- **Wider Security**: Address brute-force resistance and abuse at the API level outside of DTO.

**Note**: This code is a DTO and the majority of the security implementation should be enforced in service logic, controllers, and configuration. However, careless DTO field exposure and weak validation can result in serious vulnerabilities when the DTO is used throughout the application.
