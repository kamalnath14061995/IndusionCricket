# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Under Review

`Infobip2FAVerifyPin` from `com.cricketacademy.api.service` (Java, uses OkHttp):

```java
// Code omitted for brevity â€” see user input for full content.
```

---

## 1. Hardcoded API Credentials

**Vulnerability**:  
The `"Authorization"` header contains a hardcoded API key:

```java
.addHeader("Authorization", "App d8e6109e1db62346f64a4a583cd56833-535e98b1-f2a6-4998-b6ba-52952d990796")
```

**Impact**:  
- Exposure of API credentials in source code repositories.
- Accidental leaks via version control, code review tools, or error messages.
- Rapid credential compromise if attackers get access to the codebase.

**Mitigation**:
- Store credentials in secure configuration (e.g., environment variables, secrets management tools).
- Do not commit credentials to source control.
- Rotate compromised credentials immediately and regularly.

---

## 2. Potential for Sensitive Information Leakage

**Vulnerability**:  
The program prints both HTTP status codes and raw API responses:

```java
System.out.println("Response code: " + response.code());
System.out.println("Response body: " + (response.body() != null ? response.body().string() : "null"));
System.err.println("Request failed: " + response.code() + " - " + response.message());
```

**Impact**:  
- Sensitive user information (e.g., authentication errors, rejected pins, PII) may be printed to console or logs.
- If logs are collected by log aggregators, sensitive data could leak further.

**Mitigation**:  
- Avoid logging sensitive data (such as API responses that may contain PII or authentication details).
- Use proper logging frameworks with sensitive data redaction.
- Review logged data regularly.

---

## 3. Use of HTTP for Sensitive API Calls

**Vulnerability**:  
Although the API endpoint uses HTTPS (`https://69kqdd.api.infobip.com`), improper certificate handling (untrusted roots or forced downgrades) is not handled in the code.

**Impact**:  
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, if default OkHttp SSL verification is bypassed elsewhere in the application.
- If server DNS is hijacked or under certain network attacks, API requests may be intercepted.

**Mitigation**:
- Confirm default OkHttp SSL verification is enabled and not overridden elsewhere.
- Pin server certificates when possible (`CertificatePinner`).
- Always use HTTPS endpoints for sensitive transactions.

---

## 4. Lack of Input Validation

**Vulnerability**:  
Values for `pinId` and `pinCode` are used directly in URL and JSON body without validation or sanitization.

**Impact**:  
- Maliciously crafted inputs could result in API misuse or facilitate injection attacks, depending on the backend implementation.

**Mitigation**:  
- Validate and sanitize inputs before use.
- Prevent malformed or malicious data submission by enforcing format restrictions.

---

## 5. Exposure of Implementation Details

**Vulnerability**:
The error messages printed include HTTP status and messages:

```java
System.err.println("Request failed: " + response.code() + " - " + response.message());
```

**Impact**:  
- If this code is ever deployed in a shared or production environment, implementation details can be leaked to end users or unauthorized parties.

**Mitigation**:  
- Restrict verbose error logging to development mode only.
- In production, log concise and generic error messages.

---

## 6. No Protection Against Replay Attacks

**Vulnerability**:  
The API operation involves a PIN verification flow, which may be susceptible to replay if the same `pinId` and `pinCode` pair are reused.

**Impact**:  
- If the backend API does not properly enforce single-use tokens, an attacker intercepting or capturing the credentials could replay verification attempts.

**Mitigation**:  
- Ensure the backend API implements anti-replay mechanisms (not directly fixable in client code, but mentioned here for completeness).
- Use time-limited and single-use tokens.

| Vulnerability                  | Risk Level | Mitigation                                      |
|------------------------------- |------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded API Credentials      | Critical   | Use environment variables/secrets management     |
| Sensitive Info in Logs         | High       | Redact/log carefully or avoid logging responses  |
| Insecure API Communication     | Medium     | Ensure certificate validation and HTTPS-only     |
| Lack of Input Validation       | Medium     | Validate and sanitize user input                 |
| Exposure of Impl. Details      | Medium     | Restrict detailed error messages in production   |
| Replay Vulnerability           | Low/External | Confirm with backend provider / API             |

# Recommendations

- **NEVER** hardcode API credentials.
- Sanitize input and avoid logging sensitive or unfiltered data.
- Always use HTTPS and verify certificates.
- Use proper error handling and logging for production.
- Regularly audit and rotate secrets.
- Apply input validation for user-controlled values.

**If any of the above issues are present in code that reaches production, the safety and privacy of user data, as well as the security of your platform and integrated services, will be at serious risk.**
