# Security Vulnerability Report

**File:** `CashfreeService.java`  
**Context:** Code review focused solely on security vulnerabilities.

---

## 1. Sensitive Credentials Management

**Issue:**  
The `appId` and `secretKey` are injected using `@Value` from application properties. Although this is a common approach, it can be dangerous if:

- The properties file is stored in source control or accessible to unauthorized users.
- There is no vault management or rotation.
- Logging or error messages might accidentally leak these credentials.

**Recommendation:**  
- Use a secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.) for storing sensitive credentials.
- Ensure that sensitive fields are not logged or exposed (including stack traces).

---

## 2. Hardcoded Environment Endpoint Selection

**Issue:**  
The code selects between sandbox and production endpoints based on a string value (`env`). There is a risk that an attacker could alter the environment variable or that misconfiguration may cause accidental exposure of production details during test runs.

**Recommendation:**  
- Lock down environment variable setting and processing.
- Use strict validation for config values, possibly using an enum for allowed environments.
- Implement runtime checks/audits to verify correct environment usage.

---

## 3. Use of Plain RestTemplate Without Secure Configuration

**Issue:**  
- No custom `RestTemplate` configuration: By default, `RestTemplate` does not perform hostname verification, SSL pinning, or enforce strong TLS unless specifically configured.
- No timeout is set for the HTTP requests, making the application vulnerable to denial-of-service by keeping connections open.

**Recommendation:**  
- Customize the `RestTemplate` bean to enforce secure SSL settings, timeouts, and connection pooling.
- Use a factory with secure defaults (e.g., `RestTemplateBuilder`).
- Consider enabling hostname verification and SSL pinning if feasible.

---

## 4. Potential for Information Leakage

**Issue:**  
- Throwing a generic `RuntimeException` with a static error message on order failure gives no details to the caller, but there is a risk that upstream handling may inadvertently log or reveal sensitive information especially if the stack trace is included.
- The code does not sanitize `orderId`, `customerEmail`, or `customerPhone` before further processing, risking injection into logs if used elsewhere.

**Recommendation:**  
- Sanitize and validate input fields to prevent injection and information leakage.
- Ensure error handling/logging mechanisms do not expose response entities or sensitive data.

---

## 5. Untrusted Input Handling

**Issue:**  
- Input parameters (`orderId`, `orderAmount`, `customerEmail`, `customerPhone`) are received and used without validation or sanitization.
- Especially for values sent to other APIs, validate format and ensure values cannot break protocol or trigger logic issues.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement stringent input validation on all request parameters.
- Use robust pattern checks for email, phone, amounts, and IDs.

---

## 6. Lack of Response Validation

**Issue:**  
- The response from Cashfree API is trusted blindly. If there is a man-in-the-middle attack or the Cashfree service is compromised, malicious responses could go unchecked.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement strict validation of response structure before processing values (`payment_session_id`).
- Consider signature verification if supported by the payment API.

---

## 7. No Request/Response Logging Security

**Issue:**  
- No explicit log handling, but if future updates add logging for requests/responses, risk of leaking PII/credentials is high without proper redaction.

**Recommendation:**  
- If enabling logs, redact or obfuscate all sensitive headers and fields.
- Use log filters to prevent accidental credential/PII exposure.

|----------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Credentials in properties        | High       | Use secret management service                        |
| Environment selection            | Medium     | Use enums/validate; restrict env variable access     |
| Insecure RestTemplate usage      | High       | Secure SSL, set timeouts, consider pinning           |

# Final Notes

While the core code executes a payment order as expected, mitigating these security vulnerabilities is essential before using this service in any production environment, especially given the financial and PII data involved in payment processing.

**Always follow the principle of least privilege, input/output validation, and robust auditing/logging practices** for all payment-related services.
