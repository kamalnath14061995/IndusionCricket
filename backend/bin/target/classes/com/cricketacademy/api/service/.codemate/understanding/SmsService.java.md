# SmsService Class Documentation

## Overview

`SmsService` is a Spring service responsible for sending SMS messages (specifically OTPs) to users using the Infobip SMS API. It acts as an integration layer, encapsulating the logic for constructing requests and handling responses for sending SMS through a third-party service.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Sending OTP via SMS:** Provides a method to send a one-time password (OTP) to a specified phone number using Infobip's advanced SMS API.
- **API Communication:** Handles HTTP requests and responses with the Infobip SMS endpoint, including setting necessary headers and payload formats.

## Major Components

### Configuration

- **BASE_URL:** The endpoint for Infobip's SMS API (`https://api.infobip.com/sms/2/text/advanced`).
- **API_KEY:** The InfoBip API key, read from environment variables (and defaulting to a placeholder if not present). **Note:** There are TODOs to ensure these are securely handled, suggesting use of configuration files or environment variables.

### Method: `sendOtp(String phoneNumber, String otp)`

- **Purpose:** Sends an OTP SMS to the given phone number.
- **Input Parameters:**
  - `phoneNumber`: Destination phone number (in international format).
  - `otp`: The OTP code to be sent.
- **Process:**
  1. Constructs a message payload, including the sender, recipient, and message text.
  2. Sets up HTTP headers for JSON content and API authentication.
  3. Sends an HTTP POST request to the Infobip API using `RestTemplate`.
  4. Returns `true` if the SMS was sent successfully (i.e., received a HTTP 2XX response), otherwise returns `false` on error or failure.
- **Exception Handling:** Catches all exceptions and returns `false` (failure), with a note to improve error logging for production.

## Best Practices / Security Notes

- **Hardcoded credentials**: The API key should not be hardcoded or committed in code; it should be configured externally (environment variables or config files).
- **Error Logging:** Exceptions are silently caught; proper logging should be introduced in production.

## Dependencies

- **Spring Framework:** Uses `@Service` annotation for dependency injection.
- **RestTemplate:** For making HTTP requests.
- **Spring HTTP Classes:** For handling HTTP headers, entities, and responses.

## Extensibility

- The service can be extended to support more SMS features or to integrate with additional SMS providers.
- Error handling and response parsing could be enhanced for robustness and better monitoring.

---

**Summary:**  
`smsService` is a centralized utility for sending OTP codes via SMS, integrating with the Infobip API, with a focus on ease of use within a Spring-based application. It needs further enhancements for production-level security and error handling.
