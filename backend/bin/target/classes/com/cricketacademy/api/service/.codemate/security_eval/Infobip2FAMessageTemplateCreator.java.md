# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code: Infobip2FAMessageTemplateCreator.java

---

## 1. Hardcoded API Key / Authorization Token

**Location:**
```java
.addHeader("Authorization", "App d8e6109e1db62346f64a4a583cd56833-535e98b1-f2a6-4998-b6ba-52952d990796")
```

**Risk:**
- **Critical**: Hardcoding API keys or secrets in source code exposes them to anyone with code or binary access (e.g., in version control, builds, or deployments).
- **Exploitation:** Exposure of an API key enables attackers to perform privileged actions, including sending messages, potentially incurring costs or violating user privacy.

**Mitigation:**
- Load sensitive credentials (API keys, tokens, etc.) from a secure external source such as **environment variables**, **configuration files (outside version control)**, or **secrets manager** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

---

## 2. Lack of HTTPS Certificate Pinning

**Location:**  
```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient().newBuilder().build();
```

**Risk:**
- **Moderate**: Using HTTPS is good, but without certificate pinning, malicious intermediaries (e.g., man-in-the-middle with a rogue CA) could intercept or manipulate requests/responses.

**Mitigation:**
- Configure OkHttp's `CertificatePinner` to restrict connections to the legitimate Infobip certificate(s).

---

## 3. Command-Line Argument Injection

**Location:**  
```java
String appId = args[0];
...
.url("https://69kqdd.api.infobip.com/2fa/2/applications/" + appId + "/messages")
```

**Risk:**
- **Moderate**: If this application is called from an untrusted source, passing user-controlled (unvalidated) data directly into URLs can lead to:
    - **Path traversal** (if URL structure allows)
    - **Log injection**
    - Potential **open redirect** or **incorrect API endpoint** requests

**Mitigation:**
- **Validate** and **sanitize** all inputs. Ensure `appId` contains only allowed characters (e.g., alphanumeric/hyphens, as per Infobip's requirements).

---

## 4. Sensitive Information in Console Output

**Location:**  
```java
System.out.println("Response body: " + (response.body() != null ? response.body().string() : "null"));
```

**Risk:**
- **Low-Moderate**: Printing full HTTP response bodies can expose sensitive API responses (possibly containing user information or secrets), especially in production logs or shared environments.

**Mitigation:**
- Limit or sanitize logging of response data.
- Log only necessary and non-sensitive information.

---

## 5. No Timeouts Set in OkHttpClient

**Location:**  
```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient().newBuilder().build();
```

**Risk:**
- **Low**: Not security-critical by itself, but absence of timeouts may allow for **Resource Exhaustion** (Denial of Service) attacks if an attacker leverages slow or hanging responses.

**Mitigation:**
- Set reasonable connect and read timeouts.

---

## 6. Lack of Error Handling for Sensitive Data

**Location:**
Outputs entire error messages, codes, and potentially user-controlled input when requests fail.

**Risk:**
- **Low**: Can assist attackers with reconnaissance if error messages or stack traces are shown.

**Mitigation:**
- Avoid exposing stack traces, internal error specifics, or user-controlled data in logs or error messages.

## Summary of Vulnerabilities Table

| Vulnerability                        | Severity   | Recommendation                                      |
|---------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded API key/token               | Critical   | Use environment variables or secrets storage        |
| No certificate pinning (HTTPS only)   | Moderate   | Use OkHttp `CertificatePinner`                     |
| Input not validated (command-line)    | Moderate   | Sanitize and validate inputs (appId)               |
| Sensitive response in log output      | Low-Moderate| Sanitize/log only non-sensitive data               |
| No timeouts on HTTP client            | Low        | Set explicit connect/read timeouts                  |
| Error handling exposes info           | Low        | Generalize error messages/logging                  |

## Recommendations

- **Move the Authorization key out of code**: Never commit secrets to source repositories.
- **Validate all user input**: Accept only whitelisted patterns for `appId`.
- **Enhance HTTP Client security**: Use certificate pinning, and configure timeouts.
- **Restrict console/log output**: Avoid logging sensitive data.
- **Generalize errors**: Avoid leaking sensitive details through errors/exceptions.

**Addressing these issues will significantly improve the security posture of this application.**
