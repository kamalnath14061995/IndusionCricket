# Security Vulnerability Report

## Subject

**File:** `CareerApplicationService.java`  
**Package:** `com.cricketacademy.api.service`  
**Context:** Service class for managing career applications in a Spring-based backend.

---

## Overview

This report analyzes the provided code for security vulnerabilities or insecure coding practices. The focus is on access control, data exposure, input/output handling, logging, exception handling, and transaction management.

---

## Findings

### 1. Insufficient Access Control

**Observation:**  
All service methods (`submitApplication`, `getAllApplications`, `getApplicationsByStatus`, `updateApplicationStatus`, `getApprovedCoaches`, `getApplicationById`) are public and accessible from any caller that can access the service bean.

**Risks:**
- Sensitive data (e.g., all career applications, status data) can be exposed to unauthorized users.
- Modifications (such as updating the status of applications) can be performed by anyone, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data tampering.

**Recommendation:**
- Apply appropriate method-level access controls using Spring Security annotations such as `@PreAuthorize`, `@Secured`, or other mechanisms to enforce authorization checks.
- Ensure caller authentication before allowing access to sensitive or modifying operations.

---

### 2. Information Leakage Through Logging

**Observation:**  
Sensitive information about applications (such as position type and IDs) is logged using `logger.info`, and exception messages are logged with `logger.error`.

**Risks:**
- Exposure of sensitive application information in logs, which may be accessible to unauthorized personnel or attackers.
- Exception stack traces may contain sensitive internal logic or data if `e` includes such information.

**Recommendation:**
- Avoid logging sensitive or personally identifiable information.
- Mask or omit sensitive fields (e.g., applicant names, emails, or any private data, if present in `application`).
- Avoid logging raw exception messages if they contain user data or implementation details.
- Implement log sanitization and redact sensitive information where possible.

---

### 3. Unhandled Input Validation & Mass Assignment

**Observation:**  
There is no validation or sanitization of the input `CareerApplication application` before saving it, nor is there any indication that such checks are being enforced in this layer.

**Risks:**
- An attacker could submit malicious payloads or unexpected values, including overposting/mass assignment attacks if the `CareerApplication` entity allows mapping to unintended fields (e.g., admin/authorization flags).
- Application-level constraints might be bypassed.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement explicit input validation (size, type, format, etc.) on fields.
- Consider using DTOs with whitelisting and proper validation annotations (`@Valid`), rather than accepting the entity as-is.
- Protect sensitive/entity-level fields from overposting/mass assignment.

---

### 4. Verbose Exception Handling

**Observation:**  
Service methods throw generic `RuntimeException` with error details in some cases (`"Failed to save career application"`, `"Application not found"`).

**Risks:**
- Without proper mapping to HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 400), generic exceptions may reveal implementation details or result in unexpected behaviors at the API layer.
- Attackers could infer system state or business logic by causing and observing error messages.

**Recommendation:**
- Throw specific, well-defined exceptions, and map them to appropriate sanitized error responses at the controller level.
- Avoid exposing raw exception messages to clients or logs if they may leak internal logic.

---

### 5. No Audit/Ownership Checks

**Observation:**  
API methods such as `updateApplicationStatus` and `getApplicationById` allow operations based on the numeric ID alone.

**Risks:**
- Anyone who can guess or enumerate IDs can retrieve or modify any application, including those not owned by them (Insecure Direct Object Reference, IDOR).
- No audit trail is mentioned.

**Recommendation:**
- Verify that the authenticated user is authorized to access or modify the requested resource.
- Add audit logging for critical operations.
- Always perform ownership checks where applicable.

---

### 6. Potential for Mass Data Exposure

**Observation:**  
The method `getAllApplications` returns all stored applications without filtering.

**Risks:**
- Potential data breach if endpoint is not properly protected, as it may return all candidate data.

**Recommendation:**
- Restrict access to privileged roles (e.g., admin, HR).
- Implement paging and filtering to reduce the amount of data exposed in a single call.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                       | Location/Method(s)             | Risk Level | Recommendation                          |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Insufficient access control          | All methods                   | High       | Add authentication/authorization checks |
| Information leakage in logging       | `logger.info`/`logger.error`  | Medium     | Sanitize logs, avoid sensitive info     |
| Unhandled input validation           | `submitApplication`           | High       | Validate/sanitize input data            |
| Verbose/generic exception handling   | Multiple                      | Medium     | Use sanitized, specific exceptions      |
| No ownership/audit checks (IDOR)     | `getApplicationById`, `updateApplicationStatus` | High | Enforce ownership/audit checks          |
| Mass data exposure                   | `getAllApplications`          | High       | Restrict & paginate data access         |

## Conclusion

The provided code lacks critical security protections that could lead to serious vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data leakage, mass assignment, and insufficient logging practices. Remediation should prioritize access control, input validation, and secure logging.

**Action Required:**  
Review all exposed service methods, implement method-level security, verify data ownership before access/modification, harden log handling, and validate all inputs.
