# High-Level Documentation: `Infobip2FAVerifyPin` Java Class

## Overview
The `Infobip2FAVerifyPin` class provides a simple command-line interface for verifying a 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) PIN using Infobip's API service. It accepts user inputs, constructs a HTTP POST request with the provided PIN information, and communicates with Infobip's 2FA verification endpoint.

## Purpose
- To allow users to verify a 2FA PIN code against a given `pinId` through Infobip's REST API, typically used in authentication flows.

## Key Features
1. **Command-line Arguments**
   - Takes two inputs:
     - `pinId`: The identifier for the generated PIN session.
     - `pinCode`: The actual PIN code to be verified.

2. **HTTP Client Usage**
   - Utilizes the OkHttp client library to build and execute the HTTP POST request.

3. **API Communication**
   - Sends a POST request to Infobip's 2FA verification endpoint, including the PIN for verification in the request JSON body.
   - Adds required headers for authorization and content type.

4. **Response Handling**
   - Prints both the HTTP response code and response body.
   - If the request is unsuccessful, it prints the error code and message.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Provides command usage instructions if incorrect arguments are provided.
   - Handles and reports unsuccessful HTTP responses.

## Security Consideration
- The authorization key is hardcoded for demonstration purposes; in production, sensitive credentials should not be stored in source code.

## Usage
```bash
java Infobip2FAVerifyPin <pinId> <pinCode>
```
- Replace `<pinId>` and `<pinCode>` with actual values from your 2FA operation.
