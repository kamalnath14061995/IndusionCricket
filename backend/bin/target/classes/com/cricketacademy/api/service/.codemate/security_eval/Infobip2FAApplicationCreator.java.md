# Security Vulnerability Report

## Analyzed Component

**Class:** `Infobip2FAApplicationCreator`  
**Package:** `com.cricketacademy.api.service`  
**Purpose:** Sends an HTTP POST request to Infobip's 2FA Application API.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Hardcoded Sensitive Information**

**Location:**  
```java
.addHeader("Authorization", "App d8e6109e1db62346f64a4a583cd56833-535e98b1-f2a6-4998-b6ba-52952d990796")
```

**Risk:**  
- **High:** Hardcoding API keys or credentials in source code exposes them to all users with source access, creates a potential for accidental leaks (e.g. via public repositories), and significantly increases the surface for unauthorized access if code is shared inadvertently.
- **Impact:** Attackers obtaining repository or binary access can extract the API key and perform unauthorized access to Infobip services, leading to data leakage, financial damage, or account takeover.

**Recommendation:**  
- Store secrets securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools.
- Never commit sensitive data to version control.
- Rotate API keys that have been exposed.

### 2. **Lack of HTTPS Certificate/Hostname Verification Configuration**

**Location:**  
```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient().newBuilder().build();
```

**Risk:**  
- **Moderate:** While OkHttp performs HTTPS/TLS checks by default, there is no explicit configuration here ensuring strong/necessary SSL certificate pinning or hostname verification. If future code changes disable these checks (e.g., by adding custom trust managers), it may introduce MITM (man-in-the-middle) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact:** If SSL validation is disabled, attackers could intercept or tamper with sensitive traffic.

**Recommendation:**  
- Do not disable SSL validation; if custom trust management is needed, ensure it validates the endpoint strictly.
- Consider implementing certificate pinning for high-security applications.

### 3. **Excessive Pin Attempts & Weak Rate Limiting**

**Location:**  
```json
"configuration": {
  "pinAttempts":10,
  ...
}
```

**Risk:**  
- **Moderate:** The configuration allows 10 PIN attempts. If this input is accepted server-side, it may increase the attack surface for brute force attempts. Rate limits such as `"sendPinPerApplicationLimit":"100/1d"` may be too permissive depending on context, facilitating abuse.
- **Impact:** Attackers may exploit weak limits to brute-force or flood the 2FA system.

**Recommendation:**  
- Limit `pinAttempts` to the minimum practical number (commonly 3-5).
- Apply stricter rate limits as appropriate for production.
- Validate limits server-side, not only client-side.

---

### 4. **No Input or Output Sanitization/Validation**

**Risk:**  
- **Low:** While there is no direct user input here, should this code be refactored to accept dynamic input from external sources, lack of input validation or output handling could introduce security issues such as injection attacks.

**Recommendation:**  
- Validate and sanitize all dynamic inputs if the code will be adapted for broader use.

---

### 5. **Potential Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs**

**Location:**  
```java
System.out.println("Response body: " + ...);
```

**Risk:**  
- **Low to Moderate:** Logging full response bodies may include sensitive identifiers or error traces, which could be captured by logging infrastructure or accidentally output to logs accessible by unauthorized parties.

**Recommendation:**  
- Avoid logging sensitive information or sanitize log output.
- Restrict access to application logs.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                           | Severity   | Recommendation                          |
|------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded API Key                        | High       | Use environment variables / secrets mgr  |
| SSL Handling (future risk)               | Moderate   | Keep SSL/TLS strict, consider pinning    |
| Weak PIN/Rate Limits                     | Moderate   | Tighten limits, validate server-side     |
| Input/Output Sanitization (precaution)   | Low        | Validate/sanitize if code changes        |
| Sensitive Data in Logs                   | Low/Moderate| Sanitize logs, restrict access           |

## Remediation Steps

1. **Remove the hardcoded API key** from the codebase and load it securely at runtime.
2. **Review and tighten 2FA configuration settings** before deployment.
3. **Audit logging statements**; avoid logging sensitive information.
4. **Educate developers** on secure handling of secrets and best practices for API security.
5. **Review OkHttpClient usage** regularly to ensure SSL/TLS validation remains enabled, especially if customizations are introduced.

**Note:** Immediately rotate the Infobip API key exposed in this sample code if it was ever used in a real environment.  
**NEVER** check sensitive credentials into version control.
