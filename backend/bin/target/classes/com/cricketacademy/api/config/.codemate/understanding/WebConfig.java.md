# High-Level Documentation: WebConfig Class

## Overview
The `WebConfig` class is a Spring Boot configuration class responsible for customizing the way static resources are served in a web application, particularly for Single Page Applications (SPAs) where URL routing is managed client-side.

## Key Functionality

- **Static Resource Handling:** 
  - Maps all HTTP requests (`/**`) to static resources located in the `classpath:/static/` directory.

- **Custom Resource Resolution:**
  - Uses a custom `PathResourceResolver` that:
    - Serves the requested static resource if it exists and is readable.
    - Falls back to serving `/static/index.html` when the requested resource does not exist, ensuring seamless client-side routing for SPAs (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js frontends).

## Use Case
This configuration is commonly used to:
  - Serve frontend assets (HTML, JS, CSS) from the `static` directory.
  - Ensure that requests to routes not recognized by the backend still load the single-page application, enabling client-side routing to work correctly.

## Annotations & Interfaces

- `@Configuration`: Indicates that this class provides Spring configuration.
- Implements `WebMvcConfigurer`: Allows for customizations of Spring MVC settings.

## Customization
Developers can expand or modify this configuration to adjust how static resources are served, or to alter the fallback mechanism for other types of static content delivery.

**In summary:**  
`WebConfig` enables efficient handling and fallback routing for SPAs by serving static resources with a custom resolver in a Spring Boot application.
