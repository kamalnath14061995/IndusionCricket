# DebugFilter Class - High-Level Documentation

## Overview
`DebugFilter` is a Spring-managed filter component designed for debugging and development purposes within a Java web application context. It intercepts all incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses, logging comprehensive details about them to assist in troubleshooting and monitoring.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Request Inspection & Logging**  
  Logs key details about every HTTP request, including:
  - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
  - Request URI and full URL
  - Path and contextual information
  - Query parameters
  - Remote address, host, and port
  - All HTTP headers
  - All request parameters

- **Response Reporting**  
  After the request has been processed, logs basic response information:
  - HTTP status code
  - Content type of the response

## Integration
- **Automatic Component Registration**  
  Annotated with `@Component`, allowing automatic detection and configuration by Spring Boot without extra setup.
- **Filter Lifecycle**  
  Implements Jakarta's `Filter` interface and participates in the servlet filter chain via `doFilter()`.

## Use Cases
- **Debugging HTTP Requests and Responses**  
  Assists developers in understanding what data is being sent and received through the API.
- **Audit Trail for Troubleshooting**  
  Provides an audit trail in logs that can help diagnose issues with client-server communication.

## Limitations
- May log sensitive information (headers, parameters), so use with care in production.
- Focused solely on logging; does not modify or inspect payloads/bodies.
