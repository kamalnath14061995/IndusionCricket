## Security Vulnerabilities

After reviewing the code provided for the class `UserAlreadyExistsException`, the following analysis was made based solely on security concerns:

### 1. Information Leakage

**Description:**  
The constructor exposes a string `message` that is passed into the parent (`RuntimeException`) where it could later be returned directly in API responses or logs. If the messages passed to this exception include sensitive information (such as usernames, emails, internal state, or system-specific details), it can lead to **information leakage**.

**Risk:**  
- Attackers may use information from exception messages to enumerate existing users or gain insights into the system's internal logic.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure that messages passed to this exception do not contain sensitive information.
- Prefer generic messages like "Registration failed: user already exists" rather than exposing details such as the specific username or email.

---

### 2. Exception Chaining and Internal Error Exposure

**Description:**  
The second constructor allows chaining another exception (`Throwable cause`). If the `cause` is attached and the entire exception chain is included in HTTP responses or logs, sensitive stack traces or internal errors could be leaked to end-users.

**Risk:**  
- Detailed stack traces or internal error information can be used by an attacker to understand the system's structure and pinpoint vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation:**  
- Ensure that when exceptions are handled, stack traces and cause details are only logged securely, and not exposed to end users or in potentially insecure logs.
- Mask or format error responses sent to the client to avoid exposing underlying cause details.

### 3. Absence of Class-specific Issues

**Note:**  
There are no serialization logic, reflection usage, or injection points in this class. It does not manage resources, handle authentication, or perform any operations that usually cause security concerns.

| Vulnerability           | Location/Concern              | Recommendation                                                    |
|------------------------ |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Information Leakage     | Exception message content     | Only use generic, non-sensitive messages in exception construction |
| Internal Error Exposure | Exception cause/chaining      | Never expose stack traces or chained causes to end users           |

## Final Assessment

The `UserAlreadyExistsException` class itself does not contain direct security vulnerabilities; however, **how it is used may cause information disclosure.** The main risk is the potential for sensitive information to be included in exception messages or causes and then exposed. All sensitive data handling must occur in higher application layersâ€”especially error handling routines and logging.

**No code changes are strictly necessary in this class, but usage guidelines and error handling policy must enforce secure exception message management.**
