# Code Review Report

**File:** `ValidationException.java`  
**Package:** `com.cricketacademy.api.exception`

## General Observations

- The class properly extends `RuntimeException` for unchecked exception handling.
- JavaDoc is present, but limited.
- No unoptimized or major code errors observed for a simple exception class.
- However, if industry standards and robustness are to be followed, there are some improvements and considerations.

---

## Observations and Suggestions

### 1. Provide All Standard Constructors

**Issue:**  
It's a common best practice to provide all standard exception constructors, including a no-argument constructor and a constructor accepting `Throwable`. This allows for greater flexibility and compatibility with frameworks and libraries which might expect these constructors.

**Suggested code (pseudo code):**
```java
// Add a no-argument constructor
public ValidationException() {
    super();
}

// Add a constructor with only Throwable cause
public ValidationException(Throwable cause) {
    super(cause);
}
```

### 2. Serial Version UID

**Issue:**  
For all serializable classes, especially exceptions, define a `serialVersionUID`. This avoids deserialization issues across different JVMs and project versions.

**Suggested code (pseudo code):**
```java
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
```

---

### 3. JavaDoc Improvements

**Issue:**  
Expand JavaDoc for the class and constructors to clarify their usage.

**Suggested code (pseudo code):**
```java
/**
 * Creates a new ValidationException with {@code null} as its detail message.
 */
public ValidationException() {
    super();
}

/**
 * Creates a new ValidationException with the specified cause.
 * @param cause the cause of the exception
 */
public ValidationException(Throwable cause) {
    super(cause);
}
```

---

### 4. Minimize the Use of Public Exception Constructors

**Note:**  
All constructors here are `public`, which is acceptable for a general exception class. If this exception is only expected to be thrown within a specific package/module, consider using package-private constructors.

---

## Summary

- **Add standard constructors** for completeness.
- **Define `serialVersionUID`** for serialization compatibility.
- **Improve documentation** for constructors.

---

### **Suggested Additions:**

```java
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

public ValidationException() {
    super();
}

public ValidationException(Throwable cause) {
    super(cause);
}
```

---

**The above enhancements will improve maintainability and robustness, and align to industry standards for custom exceptions in Java.**
