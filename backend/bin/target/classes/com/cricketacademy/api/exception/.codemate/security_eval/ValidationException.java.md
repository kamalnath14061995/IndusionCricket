# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

```java
package com.cricketacademy.api.exception;

/**
 * Exception thrown when validation fails
 */
public class ValidationException extends RuntimeException {

    public ValidationException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }

    public ValidationException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}
```

## Security Vulnerability Assessment

### 1. Information Disclosure via Exception Messages

#### Description
The `ValidationException` class extends `RuntimeException` and allows a message (and optionally, a cause) to be passed to its constructor. If exception messages are constructed from or directly contain user input, there is a risk of information leakage (e.g., sensitive internal details or confidential data may be unintentionally revealed).

#### Example Scenario
If a `ValidationException` is thrown with a message that contains user input, and this message is then logged or displayed to the user or exposed in an API response, it can be exploited to perform:
- **Information disclosure:** Exposing internal validation logic or even sensitive user information.
- **Reflected attacks:** In rare cases, reflected XSS or log injection if these messages are not properly sanitized down the line.

#### Mitigation
- Ensure that only generic, non-sensitive validation messages are used or propagated to the client.
- Avoid including raw user input in exception messages.
- Sanitize and review all exception messages before returning them in API responses or logs.

---

### 2. Exception Handling Best Practices

#### Description
Unchecked exceptions (like `RuntimeException` and its subclasses) should be handled thoughtfully. Failing to properly catch and handle `ValidationException` can result in:
- Unintended exposure of stack traces or detailed messages to clients (especially in REST APIs).
- Denial of Service if exceptions are not handled and cause the application to crash.

#### Mitigation
- Ensure that all `ValidationException` are caught at appropriate boundaries, and that error messages sent to users/clients are generic and sanitized.
- Avoid exposing full stack traces in production environments.

---

### 3. Insecure Use of Throwable Cause

#### Description
The second constructor allows passing a `Throwable` as the cause. If exception chaining is used without caution, this could propagate sensitive exception data up the call chain, potentially leading to information leakage.

#### Mitigation
- Log only necessary details.
- Do not return `.getCause()` information to the clients.

## Code-specific Observations

- **No direct vulnerabilities are present in this class itself**; its constructors are standard for custom exceptions.
- **All potential security issues depend on usage context,** particularly on how `message` and `cause` are handled elsewhere.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Sanitize Exception Messages:** Never include raw user input or internal details in exception messages.
2. **Handle Exceptions Appropriately:** Catch `ValidationException` at appropriate layers and return generic error responses to clients.
3. **Control Logging:** Ensure logs containing exception messages do not get exposed externally and do not contain sensitive data.
4. **Review Upstream/Downstream Usage:** Audit all code that throws or handles `ValidationException` to ensure it doesn’t inadvertently leak information.

## Summary

While the `ValidationException` code provided does not contain any intrinsic security vulnerabilities, its usage can introduce vulnerabilities—primarily related to information disclosure—if exception messages are not well-managed. Security depends on how this class is integrated and used throughout the broader application.
