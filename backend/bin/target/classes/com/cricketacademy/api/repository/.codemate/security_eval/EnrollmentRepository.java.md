# Security Vulnerability Report: `EnrollmentRepository.java`

**File:** `EnrollmentRepository.java`  
**Package:** `com.cricketacademy.api.repository`  
**Dependencies:** Spring Data JPA

---

## Summary

This document reviews the given code for security vulnerabilities. The code defines a Spring Data JPA repository for managing `Enrollment` entities and provides custom query methods.

## Code Overview

```java
public interface EnrollmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Enrollment, Long> {
    List<Enrollment> findByUserId(Long userId);
    Enrollment findByUserIdAndProgramId(Long userId, Long programId);
}
```

## Security Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. SQL Injection

- **Assessment:** The repository leverages Spring Data JPA derived queries, which are parameterized by default. This effectively mitigates the risk of SQL Injection through user-provided parameters (`userId`, `programId`).
- **Conclusion:** **No SQL Injection vulnerability by design.**

### 2. Sensitive Data Exposure

- **Assessment:** The repository exposes methods that could potentially retrieve enrollment records by user ID or by a combination of user and program IDs. While the repository itself does not implement access control, if these methods are called without appropriate authorization checks at the service or controller layer, **an attacker could retrieve data for arbitrary user IDs**.
- **Potential Vulnerability:** **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**
    - If user input is mapped directly to the method parameters, and there is no enforcement of object ownership or access control, attackers could enumerate user IDs and gain unauthorized access to enrollment data.

### 3. Mass Assignment

- **Assessment:** This interface does not itself perform object creation or assignment. However, if used improperly (e.g., passing objects directly from client requests to repository functions), there could be a risk of mass assignment or over-posting vulnerabilities.
- **Conclusion:** **Not directly applicable in repository code**, but important in service/controller layers.

### 4. Error Handling / Information Disclosure

- **Assessment:** As a repository interface, error handling and exception messaging are not implemented here. However, bubbling up exceptions unhandled to the user interface could unintentionally disclose sensitive information about entity structure.
- **Conclusion:** **No direct vulnerability in this code**, but must be managed at a higher level.

### 5. Authorization Checks

- **Assessment:** The repository provides generic data access based on user-supplied IDs. It is the responsibility of the invoking service/controller to enforce that only authorized users can access or query certain records. **Repositories should never be exposed directly to clients.**
- **Potential Vulnerability:** If used without proper checks, the methods `findByUserId` and `findByUserIdAndProgramId` can expose personal information.

## Recommendations

1. **Enforce Authorization at Higher Layers**
    - Ensure that every call to these repository methods is validated against the authenticated user's permissions.
    - Implement necessary authorization checks to prevent unauthorized data access (IDOR).

2. **Validate Input**
    - Ensure that `userId` and `programId` values are validated and only accessible to users with the right permissions.

3. **Limit Data Exposure**
    - Consider implementing query methods that only return data related to the current authenticated user, instead of accepting arbitrary user IDs.

4. **Do Not Expose Repositories Directly**
    - Never expose repository interfaces or methods directly to clients (such as in REST endpoints) without proper access control.

---

## Conclusion

**No direct SQL injection or classic code-level vulnerabilities are present due to the use of parameterized JPA repository methods.**  
However, there is a significant risk of Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) if authorization is not enforced at higher layers. **Ensure that invocation of these methods is always subject to user authorization policies.**

**Risk Level:**  
:warning: **Medium - Subject to how it's used in the application, particularly around access control and data exposure.**
