# CareerApplicationRepository - High-Level Documentation

## Overview

The `CareerApplicationRepository` interface is a Spring Data JPA repository for managing `CareerApplication` entities within a cricket academy context. It provides methods to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as custom query methods for retrieving career application records based on specific criteria.

## Key Features

- **Inherits JpaRepository**: By extending `JpaRepository<CareerApplication, Long>`, it automatically inherits a full set of standard database operations for `CareerApplication` entities, using `Long` as the primary key type.

- **Custom Query Methods**:
    - **Find by Status**: Retrieve all career applications with a specific application status.
    - **Find by Position Type**: Retrieve all career applications for a specific position type.
    - **Find by Status and Position Type**: Retrieve all career applications that match both a given status and position type.

## Purpose

This repository acts as the data access layer for managing career applications, allowing service and controller layers to interact with the underlying database in a clean and efficient way, without dealing with explicit SQL queries.

## Usage Scenario

Used whenever the system needs to:
- List all applicants in a particular recruitment status or for a particular position.
- Filter applications based on status (e.g., Approved, Pending, Rejected).
- Support the backend operations for HR or admin panels in the cricket academyâ€™s application system.

## Spring Integration

Marked with the `@Repository` annotation for exception translation and Spring data integration.

**Note:** This repository relies on the naming conventions of Spring Data to automatically generate the necessary query implementations, promoting rapid application development and reducing boilerplate code.
