# Security Vulnerabilities Report for `PasswordResetUtil`

## Summary

This report analyzes the provided code for security vulnerabilities. The `PasswordResetUtil` is a standalone utility that resets a user's password in a system, taking the user email and new password as arguments. Only security vulnerabilities are addressed.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Password Provided in Plaintext via Command-Line Arguments**

- **Description:**  
  The utility takes the user's new password directly from the command-line arguments:
  ```java
  String newPassword = args[1];
  ```
  Command-line arguments are visible to any user on the same system through OS-specific process listing tools (e.g., `ps`, `top` on Linux), potentially exposing sensitive credentials.

- **Impact:**  
  Attackers or other users on the same system could retrieve passwords in plaintext, risking account compromise.

- **Mitigation:**  
  Accept the new password via a secure prompt that does not echo input (e.g., using `java.io.Console.readPassword()`), or read from a secure external file with strict permissions.

---

### 2. **Potential Logging/Exposure of Sensitive Data**

- **Description:**  
  The utility prints output and errors for diagnostic purposes:
  ```java
  System.out.println("Password reset successfully for user: " + email);
  System.err.println("Failed to reset password: " + e.getMessage());
  e.printStackTrace();
  ```
  This may expose sensitive user information and potentially sensitive error messages into logs or standard output.

- **Impact:**  
  Email addresses and possibly stack traces with sensitive information or internal logic are exposed to system logs, which can be read by other users or log aggregation systems.

- **Mitigation:**  
  Avoid printing or logging sensitive data such as email addresses and stack traces. If logging is necessary, use secure logging libraries and redact sensitive details.

---

### 3. **Lack of Authentication/Authorization Controls**

- **Description:**  
  The tool allows password reset functionality without verifying the identity or permissions of the user running the utility.

- **Impact:**  
  Any user with shell access can reset the password of any account, possibly leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized account compromise.

- **Mitigation:**  
  Implement authentication and authorization checks ensuring only trusted system administrators can execute the password reset. Apply access control at the OS level (restrict execution permissions), or by adding authentication prompts.

---

### 4. **Possible Missing Password Strength Validation**

- **Description:**  
  There is no check for password complexity or strength in the code itself before resetting:
  ```java
  userService.resetUserPassword(email, newPassword);
  ```
  If `UserService` does not enforce password strength, weak passwords could be set.

- **Impact:**  
  Attackers or negligent users could set easily guessable passwords.

- **Mitigation:**  
  Ensure `resetUserPassword` validates password strength, or add explicit password policy checks in the utility.

---

## Additional Considerations

- **Sensitive Data Exposure in Memory:**  
  Passwords passed as `String` remain in memory until garbage collected. Prefer using `char[]` and clearing the buffer immediately after use if possible.

- **Stack Trace Disclosure:**  
  Printing stack traces on error reveals implementation details which should not be exposed in a security-sensitive tool.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Replace command-line password input with a secure prompt.**
2. **Restrict execution of this tool to authorized administrators only.**
3. **Redact sensitive data from outputs and logs.**
4. **Validate password strength before resetting.**
5. **Avoid exposing email addresses and stack traces in logs or output.**

## Conclusion

The current implementation of `PasswordResetUtil` contains several critical security flaws, primarily surrounding plaintext password exposure, lack of authentication, and failure to redact sensitive data. These issues should be addressed before deploying or using this tool in a production environment.
