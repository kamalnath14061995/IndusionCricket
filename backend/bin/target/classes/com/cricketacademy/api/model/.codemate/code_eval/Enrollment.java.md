# Code Review Report for `Enrollment` Entity

## Package: `com.cricketacademy.api.model`
### File: Enrollment.java

---

## Summary

The code represents a JPA Entity for enrollments. Although it follows some standard practices and uses Lombok to reduce boilerplate, there are several points that may be improved for better reliability, maintainability, and clarity. This review identifies issues related to best practices, optimizations, and correctness.

---

## Issues Found and Suggestions

### 1. Missing Table Name Annotation
**Issue:**  
No explicit `@Table` annotation. While not strictly required, explicitly specifying the table name increases clarity and future scalability.

**Suggestion:**  
```java
@Table(name = "enrollment")
```

---

### 2. Use of Primitive Wrapper Types for Foreign Keys  
**Issue:**  
The `userId` and `programId` are likely to be foreign keys, but are currently modeled as simple `Long` fields. Prefer `@ManyToOne` associations for maintainability and data integrity.

**Suggestion:**  
```java
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinColumn(name="user_id", nullable=false)
private User user;

@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinColumn(name="program_id", nullable=false)
private Program program;
```
*(You will need to remove the fields `private Long userId;` and `private Long programId;`)*

### 3. Payment Method & Status Should Use Enum  
**Issue:**  
Storing status and payment method as a raw `String` is error-prone and less efficient.

**Suggestion:**  
Define enums:
```java
public enum PaymentMethod { CARD, UPI, CASH }
public enum EnrollmentStatus { PENDING, ENROLLED }
```
Then update fields:
```java
@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
@Column(nullable = false)
private PaymentMethod paymentMethod;

@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
@Column(nullable = false)
private EnrollmentStatus status;
```

---

### 4. Missing Field/Column Constraints  
**Issue:**  
`programTitle` and `coachName` fields may require length constraints, and consider `nullable=false` if they are required.

**Suggestion:**  
```java
@Column(length = 100, nullable = false)
private String programTitle;

@Column(length = 100, nullable = false)
private String coachName;
```

---

### 5. Serializable Implementation  
**Issue:**  
Entities should implement `Serializable` for JPA standards.

**Suggestion:**  
```java
public class Enrollment implements Serializable {
```

---

### 6. Lombok & JPA Conflicts  
**Issue:**  
Using Lombok with JPA entities may sometimes cause problems with lazy loading and proxying, especially with constructors.

**Suggestion:**  
Review if all-args and builder pattern is required; sometimes it's better to provide a no-arg constructor and setter methods only (depends on project requirements).

---

### 7. Field Ordering & Documentation  
**Issue:**  
Comment confusing comments, hardcoded string descriptions.

**Suggestion:**  
Add field-level Javadoc for clarity, and remove inline string value hints from comments.  
```java
/**
 * Payment method used for enrollment.
 */
private PaymentMethod paymentMethod;
```

---

### 8. Consistency in Naming  
**Issue:**  
Table/field naming conventions can be unified, e.g., plural for tables, underscores for columns, etc. Update as per your company style guide.

---

## Final Recommendations

- Use actual associations (`@ManyToOne`) for foreign keys.
- Define and use enums for constrained values.
- Always specify table/column names explicitly.
- Add field constraints and documentation.
- Implement `Serializable` in JPA entities.
- Regularly perform code reviews for future maintainability.

**Implement these suggestions in your codebase for a more robust and industry-standard JPA entity.**
