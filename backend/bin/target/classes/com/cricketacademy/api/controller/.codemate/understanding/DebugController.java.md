# DebugController - High-Level Documentation

The `DebugController` is a REST API controller designed for debugging and development purposes within the `com.cricketacademy.api.controller` package. It exposes utility endpoints for verifying API accessibility and basic server behaviors.

**Base Path:**  
All endpoints are grouped under `/api/debug`.

**CORS Support:**  
Cross-origin requests from any origin are allowed.

## Endpoints

### 1. Test Endpoint
- **Path:** `/api/debug/test`

- **Method:** GET
- **Description:**  
  Provides debugging information about security configurations, including allowed HTTP methods and whether Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled. Intended to assist with validation of CORS and HTTP method rules during development.

### 3. Echo Endpoint
- **Path:** `/api/debug/echo`
- **Method:** POST
- **Description:**  
  Receives a JSON payload in the request body and echoes it back in the response, confirming receipt. Useful for debugging payload structure and verifying API communication.

- **Intended Usage:**  
  For internal development, debugging, and testingâ€”not for production or business logic.
