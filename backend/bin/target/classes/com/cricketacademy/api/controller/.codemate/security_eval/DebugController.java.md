# Security Vulnerability Report: `DebugController`

This report analyzes the provided `DebugController` code for security vulnerabilities. **Only security-related issues are discussed.**

---

## 1. Unrestricted Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

```java
@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")
```

### **Risk**
- **High**
- By allowing all origins (`*`), you open the API endpoints to be called from any domain, enabling Cross-Origin attacks such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI).
- Sensitive endpoints are particularly at risk when exposed with permissive CORS.

### **Recommendation**
- Restrict allowed origins to trusted domains.
- Remove or limit `@CrossOrigin` especially on endpoints not intended for public use.

---

## 2. Exposed Debug Endpoints in Production

The controller exposes several endpoints such as `/api/debug/test`, `/api/debug/security-info`, and `/api/debug/echo`.

### **Risk**
- **Medium to High**
- Exposed debugging endpoints can provide information about application internals to attackers or can be abused for reconnaissance.
- `security-info` leaks implementation details such as allowed HTTP methods and CORS policy.

### **Recommendation**
- Do **not** expose debug or test endpoints in production.
- Protect debug endpoints via authentication and IP whitelisting if they must exist.
- Remove any information-leaking responses.

---

## 3. Unvalidated Input: Echo Endpoint

```java
@PostMapping("/echo")
public ResponseEntity<Map<String, Object>> echo(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> request) {
    ...
    response.put("received", request);
    ...
}
```

### **Risk**
- **Medium**
- This endpoint echoes received JSON to the response. Attackers may use this to:
  - Test for content injection
  - Bypass web application firewalls (WAFs)
  - Aid in reflected XSS or DoS attacks
- If this endpoint is ever returned in a different content-type (e.g., application/html) or the output is re-used, it could also facilitate XSS.

### **Recommendation**
- Remove generic echo/debug functionality or guard it behind authentication.
- Implement input validation and output encoding, if echo endpoints are absolutely necessary.

---

## 4. Poor HTTP Method Disclosure

```java
response.put("allowedMethods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS");
```

### **Risk**
- **Low to Medium**
- Discloses the available HTTP verbs/methods which could aid an attacker in reconnaissance for further attempts.

### **Recommendation**
- Do not disclose unnecessary implementation or configuration details in any public or debug endpoint.

---

## 5. Lack of Authentication and Authorization

### **Risk**
- **High (if running in production)**
- All endpoints are publicly available with no authentication/authorization, allowing any user (including anonymous) to access debug and info endpoints.

### **Recommendation**
- Require authentication for all non-public endpoints.

---

## 6. No Rate Limiting or Abuse Protection

Debug endpoints are unprotected and could be abused for Denial of Service (DoS).

### **Risk**
- **Medium**
- Attackers can spam debug endpoints to exhaust server resources.

### **Recommendation**
- Apply rate limiting, especially on any endpoint that echoes input or reports server state.

# **Summary Table**

| Vulnerability                  | Severity    | Recommendation                               |
|------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------|
| Unrestricted CORS              | High        | Restrict allowed origins                     |
| Exposed Debug Endpoints        | High        | Remove or protect debug/test endpoints       |
| Unvalidated Input (Echo)       | Medium      | Input validation, remove echo functionality  |
| Method Disclosure              | Low-Medium  | Do not leak server config info               |
| No AuthN/AuthZ                 | High        | Require authentication, authorization        |
| No Rate Limiting               | Medium      | Implement rate limiting                      |

# **Conclusion**

**The current implementation is NOT safe for production environments.**  
Do not expose this controller to public or untrusted networks without remediation of the above vulnerabilities. Remove or lock down debug endpoints and limit CORS to only trusted domains. Always validate and sanitize user input. Apply authentication and rate limiting as standard security best practices.
