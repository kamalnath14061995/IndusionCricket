# Security Vulnerability Report: `AuthController.java`

This report analyzes the provided `AuthController` code for **security vulnerabilities only**. Each issue is categorized according to the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) standard where possible.

---

## 1. **CORS Configuration Too Permissive**
**Vulnerability**:  
```java
@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")
```
**Details**:  
The CORS configuration allows all origins. This enables any website to interact with your API, potentially allowing malicious sites to make authenticated requests from a user's browser.  
**CWE**: [CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/942.html)

**Recommendation**:  
Restrict allowed origins to trusted domains only (e.g., your frontend domain).

---

## 2. **Sensitive Data Exposure in Logging**
**Vulnerability**:  
```java
log.info("Registration request received for email: {}", request.getEmail());
log.info("Login request received for email: {}", email);
```
**Details**:  
While not logging passwords directly, logging email addresses still constitutes PII (Personally Identifiable Information), which can lead to data leaks if logs are exposed. Exceptions are also logged, which may leak stack traces or sensitive details if not properly handled.  
**CWE**: [CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)

**Recommendation**:  
- Redact or mask all PII (including email addresses) in logs whenever possible.
- Avoid logging stack traces or exception details that include sensitive information.

---

## 3. **Potential Information Disclosure via Error Messages**
**Vulnerability**:
```java
ApiResponse<Map<String, Object>> response = ApiResponse.error(
    "Registration failed: " + e.getMessage());
...
ApiResponse<Map<String, Object>> response = ApiResponse.error("Login failed: " + e.toString());
...
ApiResponse<String> response = ApiResponse.error("Logout failed: " + e.getMessage());
```
**Details**:  
Returning server exception messages or representations directly to the user can reveal internal implementation details, error codes, or stack traces.  
**CWE**: [CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)

**Recommendation**:  
Return generic error messages (e.g., "Internal server error") without exception content, and log the details server-side instead.

---

## 4. **User Enumeration via Registration and Login**
**Vulnerability**:
- Different responses for "email already exists" vs "registration successful"
- Different responses for "Invalid email or password" vs login successful

**Details**:  
Brute-forcers can determine if an email is registered by trying to register with it or by logging in.  
**CWE**: [CWE-204: Response Discrepancy Information Exposure](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204.html)

**Recommendation**:  
- Consider returning identical messages and HTTP status codes (e.g. "Registration failed", "Login failed") regardless of whether the user exists.
- Add rate-limiting to all authentication endpoints.

---

## 5. **Insufficient Input Validation for Email and Phone Validation**
**Vulnerability**:
```java
@GetMapping("/validate-email")
public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse<Map<String, Boolean>>> validateEmail(@RequestParam String email)

@GetMapping("/validate-phone")
public ResponseEntity<ApiResponse<Map<String, Boolean>>> validatePhone(@RequestParam String phone)
```
**Details**:  
Input is not sanitized. Attackers could exploit this for enumeration or for injection (if any logging or DB operations don't parameterize input).  
**CWE**: [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

**Recommendation**:  
- Validate the format of emails/phones before processing.
- Consider rate-limiting or captcha on these endpoints.
- Double-check that underlying DAO/Repository methods use parameterized queries.

---

## 6. **Phone Number Lookup Calls findByEmail**
**Vulnerability**:
```java
boolean isAvailable = !userService.findByEmail(phone).isPresent();
```
**Details**:  
It appears you are reusing the findByEmail method for phone validation. If the database query isn’t parameterized or has weak logic, this could be exploited, especially if “phone” field is not strictly validated.

**Recommendation**:  
Call a proper findByPhone method and ensure strong input validation for phone numbers.

---

## 7. **No Account Lockout or Brute-force Protection**
**Vulnerability**:  
Repeated login attempts are not rate-limited nor is there a lockout on brute-force attempts.

**Recommendation**:  
Implement account lockout or exponential backoff (plus global IP throttling) to mitigate brute-forcing.

---

## 8. **Potential Exposure of User Data in Successful Responses**
**Vulnerability**:  
The API returns the user's email, phone, age, and experience level in responses.

**Details**:  
Clients could inadvertently log these responses or expose them. Minimize shown data to only what is strictly necessary.

---

## 9. **Token Management in JWT Logout**
**Vulnerability**:
Comments indicate logouts rely on client-side token deletion only.

**Details**:  
If you ever allow for critical privilege changes or security actions, absence of server-side token revocation can allow continued use of compromised tokens.  
**CWE**: [CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/613.html)

**Recommendation**:  
- Implement token blacklisting or a token revocation list when needed.

## **Recommendations (Summary)**

- Set CORS origins to trusted domains only.
- Avoid logging sensitive PII and stack traces.
- Return generic error messages.
- Do not allow user enumeration through error messages or registration/login APIs.
- Add input validation and rate limiting.
- Use correct methods for phone and email lookup.
- Implement brute-force/lockout protection.
- Restrict PII in responses.
- Consider JWT blacklisting for high-security actions.
