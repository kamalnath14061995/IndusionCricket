# Fix star_player_types Table Missing Error

## Issue
JsonMappingException: Table 'cricket_academy.star_player_types' doesn't exist

## Root Cause
V46 migration creates the star_player_types table, but Flyway checksum mismatch prevented it from being applied.

## Steps to Fix
- [ ] Run `mvn flyway:repair` to fix checksum mismatches
- [ ] Run `mvn flyway:migrate` to apply pending migrations
- [ ] Verify star_player_types table exists in database
- [ ] Test application to ensure error is resolved
- [ ] Update main TODO.md with resolution
