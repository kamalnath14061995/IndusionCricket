# Bookings Module Fix - Ground Type Selection Issue

## Issue Description
When changing the booking type from 'ground' to 'net practice', the booking summary was not updating the date, ground name, and time slot accordingly. The old selections remained displayed even though the facilities list changed.

## Root Cause
The `selectedFacility`, `selectedDate`, and `selectedTimeSlot` state variables were not being reset when the `bookingType` changed, causing stale data to persist in the booking summary.

## Solution Implemented
- Added a new `useEffect` hook that resets the selection state when `bookingType` changes
- The hook clears `selectedFacility`, `selectedDate`, `selectedTimeSlot`, and `availableSlots`
- This ensures clean state transitions between booking types

## Changes Made
- **File**: `project/src/pages/Bookings.tsx`
- **Lines**: Added useEffect hook around line 107
- **Code Added**:
```typescript
// Reset selections when booking type changes
useEffect(() => {
  setSelectedFacility(null);
  setSelectedDate('');
  setSelectedTimeSlot('');
  setAvailableSlots([]);
}, [bookingType]);
```

## Testing Steps
1. Select 'Ground Booking' type
2. Choose a ground, date, and time slot
3. Switch to 'Net Practice' type
4. Verify that the booking summary clears the previous selections
5. Select a net, date, and time slot
6. Verify the booking summary updates with the new selections

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Fix implemented and syntax errors resolved

## Additional Fixes Applied
- Fixed template literal syntax error (escaped backticks replaced with regular backticks)
- Added missing `BookingResponseDTO` interface definition
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
