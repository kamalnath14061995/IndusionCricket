# SSL Handshake Enhancement Plan

## Tasks Completed ✅

### 1. Enhanced SSL Configuration in UploadController.java
- [x] Add support for multiple TLS versions (TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2, SSL)
- [x] Implement cipher suite customization with modern cipher suites
- [x] Add User-Agent header to mimic browser behavior
- [x] Enhance connection timeout and retry logic
- [x] Improve error handling with specific error codes
- [x] Add detailed logging for SSL handshake diagnostics

### 2. Key Enhancements Implemented:
- **Multiple TLS Version Support**: Now tries TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2, and SSL in sequence
- **Modern Cipher Suites**: Added support for secure cipher suites including:
  - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
  - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
  - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
  - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- **Browser-like Headers**: Added User-Agent, Accept, and Accept-Language headers
- **Enhanced Timeouts**: Increased connection timeout to 15s and request timeout to 25s
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Improved error reporting with specific TLS version information

### 3. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test with various problematic URLs
- [ ] Verify TLS version compatibility
- [ ] Test retry mechanism functionality
- [ ] Validate error message clarity
- [ ] Test with different server configurations

### 4. Expected Improvements
- Better compatibility with diverse SSL/TLS server configurations
- More robust error handling and user feedback
- Improved success rate for URL uploads from various sources
- Enhanced debugging capabilities for SSL issues

## Current Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED ✅
- SSL enhancement implementation completed in UploadController.java
- Ready for testing and validation
- Documentation updated
